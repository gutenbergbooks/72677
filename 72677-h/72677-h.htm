<p><i>Nacogdoches.</i>—In this town of 500 inhabitants, we found
there was no flour. At San Augustine we had inquired in
vain at all the stores for refined sugar. Not satisfied with
some blankets that were shown us, we were politely recommended
by the shopkeeper to try other stores. At each of
the other stores we were told they had none: the only
blankets in town we should find at ——’s, naming the
one we had just quitted. The same thing occurred with
several other articles.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Houston County.</i>—This day’s ride and the next were
through a very poor country, clay or sand soil, bearing short
oaks and black-jack. We passed one small meadow, or
prairie, covered with coarse grass. Deserted plantations appeared
again in greater numbers than the occupied. One
farm, near which we stopped, was worked by eight field hands.
The crop had been fifty bales; small, owing to a dry season.
The corn had been exceedingly poor. The hands, we noticed,
came in from the fields after eight o’clock.</p>

<p>The deserted houses, B. said, were built before the date of
Texan Independence. After Annexation the owners had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
moved on to better lands in the West. One house he pointed
out as having been the residence of one of a band of pirates
who occupied the country thirty or forty years ago. They
had all been gradually killed.</p>

<p>During the day we met two men on horseback, one upon
wheels, and passed one emigrant family. This was all the
motion upon the principal road of the district.</p>

<p>The second day’s camp was a few miles beyond the town of
Crockett, the shire-town of Houston County. Not being able
to find corn for our horses, we returned to the village for it.</p>

<p>We obtained what we wanted for a day’s rest, which we
proposed for Sunday, the following day, and loaded it into our
emptied hampers. We then looked about the town for current
provisions for ourselves. We were rejoiced to find a German
baker, but damped by finding he had only molasses-cakes
and candies for sale. There was no flour in the town, except
the little of which he made his cakes. He was from Hamburgh,
and though he found a tolerable sale, to emigrants principally,
he was very tired of Crockett, and intended to move
to San Antonio among his countrymen. He offered us coffee,
and said he had had beer, but on Christmas-day a mass of
people called on him; he had “treated” them all, and they
had finished his supply.</p>

<p>We inquired at seven stores, and at the two inns for butter,
flour, or wheat-bread, and fresh meat. There was none in
town. One innkeeper offered us salt beef, the only meat, except
pork, in town. At the stores we found crackers, worth
in New York 6 cents a pound, sold here at 20 cents; poor
raisins, 30 cents; Manilla rope, half-inch, 30 cents a pound.
When butter was to be had it came in firkins from New York,
although an excellent grazing country is near the town.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Trinity Bottom.</i>—On landing on the west side of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
Trinity, we entered a rich bottom, even in winter, of an
almost tropical aspect. The road had been cut through a
cane-brake, itself a sort of Brobdignag grass. Immense trees,
of a great variety of kinds, interlaced their branches and
reeled with their own rank growth. Many vines, especially
huge grape-vines, ran hanging from tree to tree, adding to the
luxuriant confusion. Spanish moss clung thick everywhere,
supplying the shadows of a winter foliage.</p>

<p>These bottom lands bordering the Trinity are among the
richest of rich Texas. They are not considered equal, in
degree of fatness, to some parts of the Brazos, Colorado, and
Guadaloupe bottoms, but are thought to have compensation in
reliability for steady cropping.</p>

<p>We made our camp on the edge of the bottom, and for
safety against our dirty persecutors, the hogs, pitched our
tent <i>within</i> a large hog-yard, putting up the bars to exclude
them. The trees within had been sparingly cut, and we
easily found tent-poles and fuel at hand.</p>

<p>The plantation on which we were thus intruding had just
been sold, we learned, at two dollars per acre. There were
seven hundred acres, and the buildings, with a new gin-house,
worth nearly one thousand dollars, were included in the price.
With the land were sold eight prime field-hands. A quarter
of the land was probably subject to overflow, and the limits
extended over some unproductive upland.</p>

<p>When field-hands are sold in this way with the land, the
family servants, who have usually been selected from the field-hands,
must be detached to follow the fortunes of the seller.
When, on the other hand, the land is sold simply, the whole
body of slaves move away, leaving frequently wives and children
on neighbouring plantations. Such a cause of separation
must be exceedingly common among the restless, almost
nomadic, small proprietors of the South.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>But the very word “sale,” applied to a slave, implies this
cruelty, leaving, of course, the creature’s whole happiness to
his owner’s discretion and humanity.</p>

<p>As if to give the lie to our reflections, however, the rascals
here appeared to be particularly jolly, perhaps adopting Mark
Tapley’s good principles. They were astir half the night,
talking, joking, and singing loud and merrily.</p>

<p>This plantation had made this year seven bales to the hand.
The water for the house, we noticed, was brought upon heads
a quarter of a mile, from a rain-pool, in which an old negress
was washing.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>At an old Settler’s.</i>—The room was fourteen feet square,
with battens of split boards tacked on between the broader
openings of the logs. Above, it was open to the rafters,
and in many places the sky could be seen between the
shingles of the roof. A rough board box, three feet square,
with a shelf in it, contained the crockery-ware of the establishment;
another similar box held the store of meal,
coffee, sugar, and salt; a log crib at the horse-pen held the
corn, from which the meal was daily ground, and a log
smoke or store-house contained the store of pork. A canopy-bed
filled one quarter of the room; a cradle, four chairs
seated with untanned deer-hide, a table, a skillet or bake-kettle,
a coffee-kettle, a frying-pan, and a rifle laid across
two wooden pegs on the chimney, with a string of patches,
powder-horn, pouch, and hunting-knife, completed the furniture
of the house. We all sat with hats and overcoats on,
and the woman cooked in bonnet and shawl. As I sat in
the chimney-corner I could put both my hands out, one laid
on the other, between the stones of the fire-place and the
logs of the wall.</p>

<p>A pallet of quilts and blankets was spread for us in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
lean-to, just between the two doors. We slept in all our
clothes, including overcoats, hats, and boots, and covered entirely
with blankets. At seven in the morning, when we
threw them off, the mercury in the thermometer in our
saddle-bags, which we had used for a pillow, stood at 25°
Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>We contrived to make cloaks and hoods from our blankets,
and after going through with the fry, coffee and pone again,
and paying one dollar each for the entertainment of ourselves
and horses, we continued our journey.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Caldwell.</i>—Late in the same evening we reached a hamlet,
the “seat of justice” of Burleson County. We were obliged
to leave our horses in a stable, made up of a roof, in which
was a loft for the storage of provender, set upon posts,
without side-boarding, so that the norther met with no obstruction.
It was filled with horses, and ours alone were
blanketed for the night. The mangers were very shallow
and narrow, and as the corn was fed on the cob, a considerable
proportion of it was thrown out by the horses in their
efforts to detach the edible portion. With laudable economy,
our landlord had twenty-five or thirty pigs running at large
in the stable, to prevent this overflow from being wasted.</p>

<p>The “hotel” was an unusually large and fine one; the
principal room had glass windows. Several panes of these
were, however, broken, and the outside door could not be
closed from without; and when closed, was generally pried
open with a pocket-knife by those who wished to go out.
A great part of the time it was left open. Supper was served
in another room, in which there was no fire, and the outside
door was left open for the convenience of the servants in
passing to and from the kitchen, which, as usual here at
large houses, was in a detached building. Supper was, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
eaten with such rapidity that nothing had time to
freeze on the table.</p>

<p>There were six Texans, planters and herdsmen, who had
made harbour at the inn for the norther, two German shopkeepers
and a young lawyer, who were boarders, besides our
party of three, who had to be seated before the fire. We
kept coats and hats on, and gained as much warmth, from
the friendly manner in which we drew together, as possible.
After ascertaining, by a not at all impertinent or inconsiderate
method of inquiry, where we were from, which way
we were going, what we thought of the country, what we
thought of the weather, and what were the capacities and the
cost of our fire-arms, we were considered as initiated members
of the crowd, and “the conversation became general.”</p>

<p>The matter of most interest came up in this wise: “The
man made a white boy, fourteen or fifteen years old, get up
and go out in the norther for wood, when there was a great,
strong nigger fellow lying on the floor doing nothing. God!
I had an appetite to give him a hundred, right there.”</p>

<p>“Why, you wouldn’t go out into the norther yourself,
would you, if you were not obliged to?” inquired one, laughingly.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have a nigger in my house that I was afraid
to set to work, at anything I wanted him to do, at any time.
They’d hired him out to go to a new place next Thursday,
and they were afraid if they didn’t treat him well, he’d run
away. If I couldn’t break a nigger of running away, I
wouldn’t have him any how.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you how you can break a nigger of running
away, certain,” said another. “There was an old fellow I
used to know in Georgia, that always cured his so. If a
nigger ran away, when he caught him, he would bind his
knee over a log, and fasten him so he couldn’t stir; then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
he’d take a pair of pincers and pull one of his toe-nails out
by the roots; and tell him that if he ever run away again,
he would pull out two of them, and if he run away again
after that, he told them he’d pull out four of them, and so
on, doubling each time. He never had to do it more than
twice—it always cured them.”</p>

<p>One of the company then said that he was at the present
time in pursuit of a negro. He had bought him of a relative
in Mississippi, and had been told that he was a great
runaway. He had, in fact, run away from his relative three
times, and always when they caught him he was trying to
<i>get back to Illinois</i>;<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that was the reason he sold him.
“He offered him to me cheap,” he continued, “and I bought
him because he was a first-rate nigger, and I thought perhaps
I could break him of running away by bringing him
down to this new country. I expect he’s making for Mexico
now. I am a-most sure I saw his tracks on the road about
twelve miles back, where he was a-coming on this way.
Night before last I engaged with a man who’s got some first-rate
nigger dogs to meet me here to-night; but I suppose
the cold keeps him back.” He then asked us to look out for
him as we went on west, and gave us a minute description of
him that we might recognize him. He was “a real black
nigger,” and carried off a double-barrelled gun with him.
Another man, who was going on by another road westward,
offered to look for him that way, and to advertise him.
Would he be likely to defend himself with the gun if he
should try to secure him? he asked. The owner said he
had no doubt he would. He was as humble a nigger when
he was at work as ever he had seen; but he was a mighty
resolute nigger—there was no man had more resolution.
“Couldn’t I induce him to let me take the gun by pretending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
I wanted to look at it, or something? I’d talk to him
simple; make as if I was a stranger, and ask him about the
road, and so on, and finally ask him what he had got for a
gun, and to let me look at it.” The owner didn’t believe
he’d let go of the gun; he was a “nigger of sense—as much
sense as a white man; he was not one of your kinkey-headed
niggers.” The chances of catching him were discussed.
Some thought they were good, and some that the owner
might almost as well give it up, he’d got such a start. It
was three hundred miles to the Mexican frontier, and he’d
have to make fires to cook the game he would kill, and could
travel only at night; but then every nigger or Mexican he
could find would help him, and if he had so much sense, he’d
manage to find out his way pretty straight, and yet not have
white folks see him.</p>

<p>We slept in a large upper room, in a company of five, with
a broken window at the head of our bed, and another at our
side, offering a short cut to the norther across our heads.</p>

<p>We were greatly amused to see one of our bed-room companions
gravely <i>spit</i> in the candle before jumping into bed,
explaining to some one who made a remark, that he always
did so, it gave him time to see what he was about before it
went out.</p>

<p>The next morning the ground was covered with sleet, and
the gale still continued (a pretty steady close-reefing breeze)
during the day.</p>

<p>We wished to have a horse shod. The blacksmith, who
was a white man, we found in his shop, cleaning a fowling-piece.
It was too d——d cold to work, he said, and he was
going to shoot some geese; he, at length, at our urgent
request, consented to earn a dollar; but, after getting on his
apron, he found that we had lost a shoe, and took it off again,
refusing to make a shoe while this d——d norther lasted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
for any man. As he had no shoes ready made, he absolutely
turned us out of the shop, and obliged us to go
seventy-five miles further, a great part of the way over a
pebbly road, by which the beast lost three shoes before he
could be shod.</p>

<p>This respect for the north wind is by no means singular
here. The publication of the week’s newspaper in Bastrop
was interrupted by the norther, the editor mentioning, as a
sufficient reason for the irregularity, the fact that his printing-office
was in the north part of the house.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Austin.</i>—Before leaving Eastern Texas behind us, I must
add a random note or two, the dates of which it would have
been uncivil to indicate.</p>

<p>We stopped one night at the house of a planter, now
twenty years settled in Eastern Texas. He was a man of
some education and natural intelligence, and had, he told us,
an income, from the labour of his slaves, of some $4,000.
His residence was one of the largest houses we had seen in
Texas. It had a second story, two wings and a long gallery.
Its windows had been once glazed, but now, out of eighty
panes that originally filled the lower windows, thirty only
remained unbroken. Not a door in the house had been ever
furnished with a latch or even a string; when they were
closed, it was necessary to <i>claw</i> or to ask some one inside to
push open. (Yet we happened to hear a neighbour expressing
serious admiration of the way these doors fitted.) The
furniture was of the rudest description.</p>

<p>One of the family had just had a hæmorrhage of the lungs;
while we were at supper, this person sat between the big fireplace
and an open outside door, having a window, too, at his
side, in which only three panes remained. A norther was
blowing, and ice forming upon the gallery outside. Next day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
at breakfast, the invalid was unable to appear on account of a
“bad turn.”</p>

<p>On our supper-table was nothing else than the eternal fry,
pone and coffee. Butter, of dreadful odour, was here added
by exception. Wheat flour they never used. It was “too
much trouble.”</p>

<p>We were waited upon by two negro girls, dressed in short-waisted,
twilled-cotton gowns, once white, now looking as if
they had been worn by chimney-sweeps. The water for the
family was brought in tubs upon the heads of these two girls,
from a creek, a quarter of a mile distant, this occupation
filling nearly all their time.</p>

<p>This gentleman had thirty or forty negroes, and two legitimate
sons. One was an idle young man. The other was, at
eight years old, a swearing, tobacco-chewing bully and ruffian.
We heard him whipping a puppy behind the house, and
swearing between the blows, his father and mother being at
hand. His language and tone was an evident imitation of
his father’s mode of dealing with his slaves.</p>

<p>“I’ve got an account to settle with you; I’ve let you go
about long enough; I’ll teach you who’s your master; there,
go now, God damn you, but I havn’t got through with you
yet.”</p>

<p>“You stop that cursing,” said his father, at length, “it
isn’t right for little boys to curse.”</p>

<p>“What do <i>you</i> do when you get mad?” replied the boy;
“reckon you cuss some; so now you’d better shut up.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the whole journey through Eastern Texas, we did not
see one of the inhabitants look into a newspaper or a book,
although we spent days in houses where men were lounging
about the fire without occupation. One evening I took up a
paper which had been lying unopened upon the table of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
inn where we were staying, and smiled to see how painfully
news items dribbled into the Texas country papers, the loss of
the tug-boat “Ajax,” which occurred before we left New York,
being here just given as the loss of the “splendid steamer Ocax.”</p>

<p>A man who sat near said—</p>

<p>“Reckon you’ve read a good deal, hain’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; why?”</p>

<p>“Reckon’d you had.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“You look as though you liked to read. Well, it’s a good
thing. S’pose you take a pleasure in reading, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“That depends, of course, on what I have to read. I
suppose everybody likes to read when they find anything
interesting to them, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“No; it’s damn tiresome to some folks, I reckon, any how,
’less you’ve got the habit of it. Well, it’s a good thing; you
can pass away your time so.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The sort of interest taken in foreign affairs is well enough
illustrated by the views of a gentleman of property in Eastern
Texas, who was sitting with us one night, “spitting in the
fire,” and talking about cotton. Bad luck he had had—only
four bales to the hand; couldn’t account for it—bad luck;
and next year he didn’t reckon nothing else but that there
would be a general war in Europe, and then he’d be in a
pretty fix, with cotton down to four cents a pound. Curse
those Turks! If he thought there would be a general war,
he would take every d——d nigger he’d got, right down to
New Orleans, and sell them for what they’d bring. They’d
never be so high again as they were now, and if there should
come a general war they wouldn’t be worth half as much next
year. There always were infernal rascals somewhere in the
world trying to prevent an honest man from getting a living.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
Oh, if they got to fighting, he hoped they’d eat each other
up. They just ought to be, all of them—Turks, and Russians,
and Prussians, and Dutchmen, and Frenchmen—just
be put in a bag together, and slung into hell. That’s what
he’d do with them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Remarking, one day, at the house of a woman who was
brought up at the North, that there was much more comfort
at her house than any we had previously stopped at, she told
us that the only reason the people didn’t have any comfort
here was, that they wouldn’t <i>take any trouble</i> to get anything.
Anything that their negroes could make they would
eat; but they would take no pains to instruct them, or to
get anything that didn’t grow on the plantation. A neighbour
of hers owned fifty cows, she supposed, but very rarely had
any milk and scarcely ever any butter, simply because his
people were too lazy to milk or churn, and he wouldn’t take
the trouble to make them.</p>

<p>This woman entirely sustained the assertion that Northern
people, when they come to the South, have less feeling for
the negroes than Southerners themselves usually have. We
asked her (she lived in a village) whether she hired or owned
her servants. They owned them all, she said. When they
first came to Texas they hired servants, but it was very
troublesome; they would take no interest in anything; and
she couldn’t get along with them. Then very often their
owners, on some pretext (ill-treatment, perhaps), would take
them away. Then they bought negroes. It was very expensive:
a good negro girl cost seven or eight hundred
dollars, and that, we must know, was a great deal of money
to be laid out in a thing that might lie right down the next
day and die. They were not much better either than the
hired servants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>Folks up North talked about how badly the negroes were
treated; she wished they could see how much work her girls
did. She had four of them, and she knew they didn’t do half
so much work as one good Dutch girl such as she used to
have at the North. Oh! the negroes were the laziest things
in creation; there was no knowing how much trouble they
gave to look after them. Up to the North, if a girl went out
into the garden for anything, when she came back she would
clean her feet, but these nigger girls will stump right in and
track mud all over the house. What do they care? They’d
just as lief clean the mud after themselves as anything else—their
time isn’t any value to themselves. What do they care
for the trouble it gives you? Not a bit. And you may
scold ’em and whip ’em—you never can break ’em into better
habits.</p>

<p>I asked what were servants’ wages when they were hired
out to do housework? They were paid seven or eight dollars
a month; sometimes ten. She didn’t use to pay her girl at
the North but four dollars, and she knew she would do more
work than any six of the niggers, and not give half so much
trouble as one. But you couldn’t get any other help here
but niggers. Northern folks talk about abolishing slavery,
but there wouldn’t be any use in that; that would be ridiculous,
unless you could some way get rid of the niggers.
Why, they’d murder us all in our beds—that’s what they’d
do. Why, over to Fannin, there was a negro woman that
killed her mistress with an axe, and her two little ones. The
people just flocked together, and hung her right up on the
spot; they ought to have piled some wood round her, and
burned her to death; that would have been a good lesson to
the rest. We afterwards heard her scolding one of her girls,
the girl made some exculpatory reply, and getting the best
of the argument, the mistress angrily told her if she said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
another word she would have two hundred lashes given her.
She came in and remarked that if she hadn’t felt so nervous
she would have given that girl a good whipping herself;
these niggers are so saucy, it’s very trying to one who has to
take care of them.</p>

<p>Servants are, it is true, “a trial,” in all lands, ages, and
nations. But note the fatal reason this woman frankly gives
for the inevitable delinquencies of slave-servants, “Their
time isn’t any value to themselves!”</p>

<p>The women of Eastern Texas seemed to us, in general, far
superior to their lords. They have, at least, the tender
hearts and some of the gentle delicacy that your “true
Texan” lacks, whether mistresses of slaves, or only of their
own frying-pan. They are overworked, however, as soon as
married, and care gives them thin faces, sallow complexions,
and expressions either sad or sour.</p>

<p>Another night we spent at the house of a man who came
here, when a boy, from the North. His father was a
mechanic, and had emigrated to Texas just before the war of
Independence. He joined the army, and his son had been
brought up—rather had grown up—Southern fashion, with
no training to regular industry. He had learned no trade.
What need? His father received some thousand acres of
land in payment of his services. The son earned some
money by driving a team; bought some cattle, took a wife,
and a house, and now had been settled six years, with a young
family. He had nothing to do but look after his cattle, go
to the nearest town and buy meal and coffee occasionally, and
sell a few oxen when the bill was sent in. His house was
more comfortless than nine-tenths of the stables of the North.
There were several windows, some of which were boarded
over, some had wooden shutters, and some were entirely open.
There was not a pane of glass. The doors were closed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
difficulty. We could see the stars, as we lay in bed, through
the openings of the roof; and on all sides, in the walls of
the room, one’s arm might be thrust out. Notwithstanding,
that night the mercury fell below 25° of our Fahrenheit
thermometer. There was the standard food and beverage,
placed before us night and morning. We asked if there was
much game near him? There were a great many deer. He
saw them every day. Did he shoot many? He never shot
any; ’twas too much trouble. When he wanted “fresh,”
’twas easier to go out and stick a hog (the very words he
used). He had just corn enough to give our horses one feed—there
was none left for the morning. His own horses
could get along through the winter on the prairie. He made
pets of his children, but was cross and unjust to his wife, who
might have been pretty, and was affectionate. He was without
care—thoughtless, content, with an unoccupied mind.
He took no newspaper—he read nothing. There was,
indeed, a pile of old books which his father had brought from
the North, but they seemed to be all of the Tract Society
sort, and the dust had been undisturbed upon them, it might
have been, for many years.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Manchac Spring.</i>—We found a plantation that would
have done no discredit to Virginia. The house was large
and well constructed, standing in a thick grove, separated
from the prairie by a strong worm-fence. Adjacent, within,
was the spring, which deserved its prominence of mention
upon the maps. It had been tastefully grottoed with heavy
limestone rocks, now water-stained and mossy, and the pure
stream came gurgling up, in impetuous gallons, to pour
itself in a bright current out upon the prairie. The fountains
of Italy were what came to mind, and “Fontana de
Manciocco” would have secured a more natural name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Everything about the house was orderly and neat. The
proprietor came out to receive us, and issued orders about the
horses, which we felt, from their quiet tone, would be obeyed
without our supervision. When we were ushered into a
snug supper-room and found a clean table set with wheat-bread,
ham, tea, and preserved fruits, waited on by tidy
and ready girls, we could scarce think we had not got beyond
the bounds of Texas. We were, in fact, quit, for some time
to come, of the lazy poverty of Eastern Texas.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Lower Guadaloupe.</i>—Not finding a suitable camping
place, we stumbled, after dark, into a large plantation upon
the river bottom.</p>

<p>The irruption of our train within the plantation fences
caused a furious commotion among the dogs and little negroes,
and it was with no little difficulty we could explain to
the planter, who appeared with a candle, which was instantly
blown out upon the porch, our peaceable intentions. Finally,
after a general striking out of Fanny’s heels and the master’s
boots, aided by the throwing of our loose lariats into the
confused crowd, the growling and chattering circle about us
was sufficiently enlarged and subdued for us to obtain a hearing,
and we were hospitably received.</p>

<p>“Ho, Sam! You Tom, here! Call your missus. Suke!
if you don’t stop that infernal noise I’ll have you drowned!
Here, Bill! Josh! some of you! why don’t you help the
gentleman? Bring a lantern here! Packed, are you, sir.
Hold on, you there; leave the gun alone. Now, clear out
with you, you little devils, every one of you! Is there no
one in the house? St! after ’em, Tiger! Can’t any of you
find a lantern? Where’s Bill, to take these horses? What
are you doing there? I tell you to be off, now, every one of
you! Tom! take a rail and keep ’em off there!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>In the midst of the noise we go through the familiar motions,
and land our saddles and hampers upon the gallery,
then follow what appears to be the headmost negro to the
stable, and give him a hint to look well out for the horses.</p>

<p>This is our first reintroduction to negro servants after our
German experiences, and the contrast is most striking and
disagreeable. Here were thirty or forty slaves, but not an
order could be executed without more reiteration, and threats,
and oaths, and greater trouble to the master and mistress,
than would be needed to get a squadron under way. We
heard the master threaten his negroes with flogging, at least
six times, before we went to bed. In the night a heavy rain
came up, and he rose, on hearing it, to arrange the cistern
spout, cursing again his infernal niggers, who had turned it
off for some convenience of their own. In the morning, we
heard the mistress scolding her girls for having left articles
outside which had been spoiled by the wet, after repeated
orders to bring them in. On visiting the stables we found
the door fastened by a board leaned against it.</p>

<p>All the animals were loose, except the mule, which I had
fastened myself. The rope attached to my saddle was stolen,
and a shorter one substituted for it, when I mentioned the
fact, by which I was deceived, until we were too far off to
return. The master, seeing the horses had yet had no fodder,
called to a boy to get some for them, then, countermanding
his order, told the boy to call some one else, and go himself
to drive the cows out of the garden. Then, to another boy,
he said, “Go and pull two or three bundles of fodder out of
the stack and give these horses.” The boy soon came with
two small bundles. “You infernal rascal, couldn’t you tote
more fodder than that? Go back and bring four or five
bundles, and be quick about it, or I’ll lick you.” The
boy walked slowly back, and returned with four bundles more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>But on entering at night we were struck with the air of
comfort that met us. We were seated in rocking-chairs in a
well-furnished room, before a blazing fire, offered water to
wash, in a little lean-to bed-room, and, though we had two
hours to wait for our supper, it was most excellent, and we
passed an agreeable evening in intelligent conversation with
our host.</p>

<p>After his curiosity about us was satisfied, we learned from
him that, though a young man, he was an old settler, and
had made a comfortable fortune by his plantation. His wife
gave us a picturesque account of their waggon journey here
with their people, and described the hardships, dangers,
and privations they had at first to endure. Now they were
far more comfortable than they could have ever hoped to
have been in the State from which they came. They thought
their farm the best cotton land in the world. It extended
across a mile of timbered bottom land from the river, then
over a mile of bottom prairie, and included a large tract of
the big prairie “for range.” Their field would produce, in a
favourable season, three bales to the acre; ordinarily a bale
and a half: the “bale” 400 lbs. They had always far more
than their hands could pick. It was much more free from
weeds than the States, so much so, that three hands would
be needed there to cultivate the same area as two here;
that is, with the same hands the crop would be one-third
greater.</p>

<p>But so anxious is every one in Texas to give all strangers
a favourable impression, that all statements as to the extreme
profit and healthfulness of lands must be taken with a grain
of allowance. We found it very difficult, without impertinent
persistence, to obtain any unfavourable facts. Persons not
interested informed us, that from one-third to one-half the
cotton crop on some of these rich plantations had been cut off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
by the worm, on several occasions, and that negroes suffered
much with dysentery and pneumonia.</p>

<p>It cost them very little to haul their cotton to the coast or
to get supplies. They had not been more sickly than they
would have been on the Mississippi. They considered that
their steady sea-breeze was almost a sure preventive of such
diseases as they had higher up the country.</p>

<p>They always employed German mechanics, and spoke well
of them. Mexicans were regarded in a somewhat unchristian
tone, not as heretics or heathen, to be converted with flannel
and tracts, but rather as vermin, to be exterminated. The
lady was particularly strong in her prejudices. White folks
and Mexicans were never made to live together, anyhow, and
the Mexicans had no business here. They were getting so
impertinent, and were so well protected by the laws, that the
Americans would just have to get together and drive them
all out of the country.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>On the Chockolate.</i>—“Which way did you come?” asked
some one of the old man.</p>

<p>“From ——.”</p>

<p>“See anything of a runaway nigger over there, anywhar?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. What kind of a nigger was it?”</p>

<p>“A small, black, screwed-up-faced nigger.”</p>

<p>“How long has he been out?”</p>

<p>“Nigh two weeks.”</p>

<p>“Whose is he?”</p>

<p>“Judge ——’s, up here. And he cut the judge right
bad. Like to have killed the judge. Cut his young master,
too.”</p>

<p>“Reckon, if they caught him, ’twould go rather hard with
him.”</p>

<p>“Reckon ’twould. We caught him once, but he got away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
from us again. We was just tying his feet together, and he
give me a kick in the face, and broke. I had my six-shooter
handy, and I tried to shoot him, but every barrel missed fire.
Been loaded a week. We shot at him three times with rifles,
but he’d got too far off, and we didn’t hit, but we must have
shaved him close. We chased him, and my dog got close to
him once. If he’d grip’d him, we should have got him; but
he had a dog himself, and just as my dog got within about a
yard of him, his dog turned and fit my dog, and he hurt him
so bad we couldn’t get him to run him again. We run him
close, though, I tell you. Run him out of his coat, and his
boots, and a pistol he’d got. But ’twas getting towards dark,
and he got into them bayous, and kept swimming from one
side to another.”</p>

<p>“How long ago was that?”</p>

<p>“Ten days.”</p>

<p>“If he’s got across the river, he’d get to the Mexicans in
two days, and there he’d be safe. The Mexicans’d take care
of him.”</p>

<p>“What made him run?”</p>

<p>“The judge gave him a week at Christmas, and when
the week was up, I s’pose he didn’t want to go to work
again. He got unruly, and they was a goin’ to whip
him.”</p>

<p>“Now, how much happier that fellow’d ’a’ been, if he’d just
stayed and done his duty. He might have just worked and
done his duty, and his master’d ’a’ taken care of him, and
given him another week when Christmas come again, and he’d
’a’ had nothing to do but enjoy himself again. These niggers,
none of ’em, knows how much happier off they are than if
they was free. Now, very likely, he’ll starve to death, or
get shot.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the judge treats his niggers too kind. If he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
stricter with them, they’d have more respect for him, and be
more contented, too.”</p>

<p>“Never do to be too slack with niggers.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We were riding in company, to-day, with a California
drover, named Rankin. He was in search of cattle to drive
across the plains. He had taken a drove before from Illinois,
and told us that people in that State, of equal circumstances,
lived ten times better than here, in all matters of comfort and
refinement. He had suffered more in travelling in Texas,
than ever on the plains or the mountains. Not long before,
in driving some mules with his partner, they came to a house
which was the last on the road for fourteen miles. They had
nothing in the world in the house but a few ears of corn, they
were going to grind in their steel mill for their own breakfast,
and wouldn’t sell on any terms. “We hadn’t eaten anything
since breakfast, but we actually could get nothing. The only
other thing in the cabin, that could be eaten, was a pile of
deer-skins, with the hair on. We had to stake our mules,
and make a fire, and coil around it. About twelve o’clock
there came a norther. We heard it coming, and it made us
howl. We didn’t sleep a wink for cold.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Houston.</i>—We were sitting on the gallery of the hotel. A
tall, jet black negro came up, leading by a rope a downcast
mulatto, whose hands were lashed by a cord to his waist, and
whose face was horribly cut, and dripping with blood. The
wounded man crouched and leaned for support against one of
the columns of the gallery—faint and sick.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with that boy?” asked a smoking
lounger.</p>

<p>“I run a fork into his face,” answered the negro.</p>

<p>“What are his hands tied for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>“He’s a runaway, sir.”</p>

<p>“Did you catch him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. He was hiding in the hay-loft, and when I
went up to throw some hay to the horses, I pushed the fork
down into the mow and it struck something hard. I didn’t
know what it was, and I pushed hard, and gave it a turn, and
then he hollered, and I took it out.”</p>

<p>“What do you bring him here, for?”</p>

<p>“Come for the key of the jail, sir, to lock him up.”</p>

<p>“What!” said another, “one darkey catch another darkey?
Don’t believe that story.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, mass’r, I tell for true. He was down in our
hay-loft, and so you see when I stab him, I <i>have</i> to catch
him.”</p>

<p>“Why, he’s hurt bad, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he says I pushed through the bones.”</p>

<p>“Whose nigger is he?”</p>

<p>“He says he belong to Mass’r Frost, sir, on the Brazos.”</p>

<p>The key was soon brought, and the negro led the mulatto
away to jail. He walked away limping, crouching, and writhing,
as if he had received other injuries than those on his face.
The bystanders remarked that the negro had not probably
told the whole story.</p>

<p>We afterwards happened to see a gentleman on horseback,
and smoking, leading by a long rope through the deep mud,
out into the country, the poor mulatto, still limping and
crouching, his hands manacled, and his arms pinioned.</p>

<p>There is a prominent slave-mart in town, which holds a
large lot of likely-looking negroes, waiting purchasers. In the
windows of shops, and on the doors and columns of the hotel,
are many written advertisements, headed “A likely negro girl
for sale.” “Two negroes for sale.” “Twenty negro boys
for sale,” etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>South-eastern Texas.</i>—We were unable to procure at Houston
any definite information with regard to our proposed
route. The known roads thence are those that branch northward
and westward from their levee, and so thoroughly within
lines of business does local knowledge lie, that the eastern
shore is completely terra incognita. The roads east were said
to be bad after heavy rains, but the season had been dry, and
we determined to follow the direct and the distinct road, laid
down upon our map.</p>

<p>Now that I am in a position to give preliminary information,
however, there is no reason why the reader should enter this
region as ignorant as we did.</p>

<p>Our route took us by Harrisburg and San Jacinto to Liberty,
upon the Trinity; thence by Beaumont to the Sabine at Turner’s
ferry; thence by the Big Woods and Lake Charles to
Opelousas, the old capital of St. Landry Parish, at the western
head of the intricate navigation from New Orleans.</p>

<p>This large district, extending from the Trinity River to the
bayous of the Mississippi, has, throughout, the same general
characteristics, the principal of which are, lowness, flatness,
and wetness. The soil is variable, but is in greater part a
loose, sandy loam, covered with coarse grasses, forming level
prairies, which are everywhere broken by belts of pine forests,
usually bordering creeks and bayous, but often standing in
islands. The surface is but very slightly elevated above the
sea; I suppose, upon an average, less than ten feet. It is,
consequently, imperfectly drained, and in a wet season a large
proportion is literally covered with water, as in crossing it,
even in a dry time, we were obliged to wade through many
miles of marshy pools. The river-bottoms, still lower than
the general level, are subject to constant overflow by tide-water,
and what with the fallen timber, the dense undergrowth,
the mire-quags, the abrupt gullies, the patches of rotten or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
floating corduroy, and three or four feet of dirty salt water, the
roads through them are not such as one would choose for a
morning ride. The country is sparsely settled, containing
less than one inhabitant to the square mile, one in four being
a slave.</p>

<p>The many pools, through which the usual track took us,
were swarming with venemous water-snakes, four or five
black moccasins often lifting at once their devilish heads
above the dirty surface, and wriggling about our horses’
heels. Beyond the Sabine, alligator holes are an additional
excitement, the unsuspicious traveller suddenly sinking through
the treacherous surface, and sometimes falling a victim, horse
and all, to the hideous jaws of the reptile, while overwhelmed
by the engulfing mire in which he lurks.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, this is not the spot in which I should
prefer to come to light, burn, and expire; in fact, if the
nether regions, as was suggested by the dream-gentleman of
Nachitoches, be “a boggy country,” the avernal entrance
might, I should think, with good probabilities, be looked for
in this region.</p>

<p>We passed, on both sides the Sabine, many abandoned
farms, and the country is but thinly settled. We found it
impossible to obtain any information about roads, and frequently
went astray upon cattle paths, once losing twenty
miles in a day’s journey. The people were chiefly herdsmen,
cultivating a little cotton upon river-banks, but ordinarily
only corn, with a patch of cane to furnish household sugar.
We tried in vain to purchase corn for our horses, and were
told that “folks didn’t make corn enough to bread them, and
if anybody had corn to give his horse, he carried it in his hat
and went out behind somewhere.” The herds were in poor
condition, and must in winter be reduced to the verge of
starvation. We saw a few hogs, converted, by hardship, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
figures so unnatural, that we at first took them for goats.
Most of the people we met were old emigrants, from Southern
Louisiana and Mississippi, and more disposed to gaiety and
cheer than the Texan planters. The houses showed a tendency
to Louisiana forms, and the table to a French style of
serving the jerked beef, which is the general dish of the
country. The meat is dried in strips, over smoky fires, and,
if untainted and well prepared, is a tolerably savoury food.
I hardly know whether to chronicle it as a border barbarism,
or a Creolism, that we were several times, in this neighbourhood,
shown to a bed standing next to that occupied by the
host and his wife, sometimes with the screen of a shawl,
sometimes without.</p>

<p>We met with one specimen of the Virginia habit of “dipping,”
or snuff-chewing, in the person of a woman who was
otherwise neat and agreeable, and observed that a young
lady, well-dressed, and apparently engaged, while we were
present, in reading, went afterward to light her pipe at the
kitchen fire, and had a smoke behind the house.</p>

<p>The condition of the young men appeared to incline decidedly
to barbarism. We stopped a night at a house in
which a drover, bringing mules from Mexico, was staying;
and, with the neighbours who had come to look at the
drove, we were thirteen men at table. When speaking with
us, all were polite and respectful, the women especially so;
but among one another, their coarseness was incredible. The
master of the house, a well-known gentleman of the county,
who had been absent when we arrived, and at supper-time,
came afterwards upon the gallery and commenced cursing
furiously, because some one had taken his pipe. Seeing us,
he stopped abruptly, and after lighting the pipe, said, in a
rather peremptory and formal, but not uncourteous tone:
“Where are you from, gentlemen?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>“From Beaumont, sir, last.”</p>

<p>“Been out West?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Travelling?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>After pausing a moment to make up his mind—</p>

<p>“Where do you live when you are at home, gentlemen,
and what’s your business in this country?”</p>

<p>“We live in New York, and are travelling to see the
country.”</p>

<p>“How do you like it?”</p>

<p>“Just here we find it flat and wet.”</p>

<p>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Olmsted.”</p>

<p>“And what’s this gentleman’s name?”</p>

<p>“Olmsted.”</p>

<p>“Is it a Spanish name?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>He then abruptly left us, and the young men entertained
one another with stories of fights and horse-trades, and with
vulgar obscenities.</p>

<p>Shortly he returned, saying—</p>

<p>“Show you to bed now, gentlemen, if you wish.”</p>

<p>“We are ready, sir, if you will be good enough to get a
light.”</p>

<p>“A light?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“<i>A light?</i>”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Get a light?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well” (after a moment’s hesitation), “I’ll get one.”</p>

<p>On reaching the bed-room, which was in a building adjoining,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
he stood awaiting our pleasure. Thanking him, I turned
to take the light, but his fingers were the candlestick. He
continued to hold it, and six young men, who had followed us,
stood grouped around while we undressed, placing our clothes
upon the floor. Judy advanced to lie down by them. One
of the young men started forward, and said—</p>

<p>“I’ve got a right good knife.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a right good knife, if you want it.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, only I’ve got a right good knife, and if you’d
like to kill that dog, I’ll lend it to you.”</p>

<p>“Please to tell me what you mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing.”</p>

<p>“Keep your dog quiet, or I’ll kill her,” I suppose was the
interpretation. When we had covered ourselves in bed, the
host said—</p>

<p>“I suppose you don’t want the light no more?”</p>

<p>“No, sir;” and all bade us good night; but leaving the
door open, commenced feats of prolonged dancing, or stamping
upon the gallery, which were uproariously applauded.
Then came more obscenities and profanities, apropos to
fandango frolics described by the drovers. As we had barely
got to sleep, several came to occupy other beds in our room.
They had been drinking freely, and continued smoking in bed.</p>

<p>Upon the floor lay two boys of fourteen, who continued
shouting and laughing after the others had at length become
quiet. Some one soon said to one of them—</p>

<p>“You had better stop your noise; Frank says he’ll be
damn’d if he don’t come in and give you a hiding.”</p>

<p>Frank was trying to sleep upon the gallery.</p>

<p>“By ——,” the boy cried, raising himself, and drawing a
coat from under the pillow, “if he comes in here, I’ll be damn’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
if I don’t kill him. He dare not come in here. I would like
to see him come in here,” drawing from his coat pocket a
revolver, and cocking it. “By ——, you may come in here
now. Come in here, come in here! Do you here that?”
(revolving the pistol rapidly). “—— damn me, if I don’t kill
you, if you come near the door.”</p>

<p>This continued without remonstrance for some time, when
he lay down, asking his companion for a light for his pipe,
and continuing the noisy conversation until we fell asleep.
The previous talk had been much of knife and pistol fights
which had taken place in the county. The same boy was
obliging and amiable the next morning, assisting us to bring
in and saddle the horses at our departure.</p>

<p>One of the men here was a Yankee, who had lived so long
in the Slave States that he had added to his original ruralisms
a very complete collection of Southernisms, some of which
were of the richest we met with. He had been in the Texas
Rangers, and, speaking of the West, said he had been up
round the head of the Guadaloupe “heaps and cords of times,”
at the same time giving us a very picturesque account of the
county. Speaking of wolves, he informed us that on the
San Jacinto there were “<i>any dimensions</i> of them.” Obstinacy,
in his vocabulary, was represented by “damnation
<i>cussedness</i>.” He was unable to conceive of us in any other
light than as two peddlers who had mistaken their ground in
coming here.</p>

<p>At another house where we stopped (in which, by the way,
we ate our supper by the light of pine knots blazing in the
chimney, with an apology for the absence of candles), we
heard some conversation upon a negro of the neighbourhood,
who had been sold to a free negro, and who refused to live
with him, saying he wouldn’t be a servant to a nigger. All
agreed that he was right, although the man was well known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
to be kind to his negroes, and would always sell any of them
who wished it. The slave had been sold because he wouldn’t
mind. “If I had a negro that wouldn’t mind,” said the
woman of the house, “I’d break his head, or I’d sell him;
I wouldn’t have one about me.” Her own servant was standing
behind her. “I do think it would be better if there
wasn’t any niggers in the world, they do behave so bad, some
of ’em. They steal just like hogs.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>South-western Louisiana.</i>—Soon after crossing the Sabine,
we entered a “hummock,” or tract of more fertile, oak-bearing
land, known as the Big Woods. The soil is not rich, but
produces cotton, in good seasons nearly a bale to the acre,
and the limited area is fully occupied. Upon one plantation
we found an intelligent emigrant from Mississippi, who had
just bought the place, having stopped on his way into Texas,
because the time drew near for the confinement of his
wife. Many farms are bought by emigrants, he said,
from such temporary considerations: a child is sick, or a
horse exhausted; they stop for a few weeks; but summer
comes, and they conclude to put in a crop, and often never
move again.</p>

<p>It was before reaching the Big Woods, that alligator-holes
were first pointed out to us, with a caution to avoid them.
They extend from an aperture, obliquely, under ground, to a
large cavern, the walls of which are puddled by the motions
of the animal; and, being partly filled with water, form a
comfortable amphibious residence. A horseman is liable, not
only to breaking through near the orifice, but to being precipitated
into the den itself, where he will find awaiting him, a
disagreeable mixture of mire and angry jaws. In the deep
water of the bottoms, we met with no snakes; but the pools
were everywhere alive with them. We saw a great variety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
of long-legged birds, apparently on friendly terms with all
the reptiles.</p>

<p>A day’s journey took us through the Big Woods, and across
Calcasieu to Lake Charles. We were not prepared to find
the Calcasieu a superb and solemn river, two hundred and
thirty yards across and forty-five feet deep. It is navigable
for forty miles, but at its mouth has a bar, on which is sometimes
only eighteen inches of water, ordinarily thirty inches.
Schooners of light draft ascend it, bringing supplies, and
taking out the cotton raised within its reach. Lake Charles
is an insignificant village, upon the bank of a pleasant, clear
lakelet, several miles in extent.</p>

<p>From the Big Woods to Opelousas, there was no change in
the monotonous scenery. Everywhere extended the immense
moist plain, being alternate tracts of grass and pine. Nearer
Opelousas, oak appears in groups with the pine, and the soil
is darker and more fertile. Here the land was mostly taken
up, partly by speculators, in view of the Opelousas Railway,
then commenced. But, in all the western portion of the district,
the land is still government property, and many of the
people squatters. Sales are seldom made, but the estimated
price of the land is fifty cents an acre.</p>

<p>Some of the timbered land, for a few years after clearing,
yields good crops of corn and sweet potatoes. Cotton is
seldom attempted, and sugar only for family use. Oats are
sometimes grown, but the yield is small, and seldom thrashed
from the straw. We noted one field of poor rye. So wet a
region and so warm a climate suggested rice, and, were the
land sufficiently fertile, it would, doubtless, become a staple
production. It is now only cultivated for home use, the
bayou bottoms being rudely arranged for flowing the crop.
But without manure no profitable return can be obtained
from breaking the prairie, and the only system of manuring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
in use is that of ploughing up occasionally the cow-pens of
the herdsmen.</p>

<p>The road was now distinctly marked enough, but had frequent
and embarrassing forks, which occasioned us almost as
much annoyance as the clouds of musquitoes which, east of the
Sabine, hovered continually about our horses and our heads.
Notions of distance we found incredibly vague. At Lake
Charles we were informed that the exact distance to Opelousas
was ninety-six miles. After riding eight hours, we were
told by a respectable gentleman that the distance from his
house was one hundred and twenty miles. The next evening
the distance was forty miles; and the following evening a
gentleman who met us stated first that it was “a good long
way;” next, that it was “thirty or forty miles, and damn’d
long ones, too.” About four miles beyond him, we reached
the twentieth mile-post.</p>

<p>Across the bayous of any size, bridges had been constructed,
but so rudely built of logs that the traveller, where possible,
left them for a ford.</p>

<p>The people, after passing the frontier, changed in every
prominent characteristic. French became the prevailing
language, and French the prevailing manners. The gruff
Texan bidding, “Sit up, stranger; take some fry!” became a
matter of recollection, of which “Monsieur, la soupe est servie,”
was the smooth substitute. The good-nature of the people
was an incessant astonishment. If we inquired the way, a
contented old gentleman waddled out and showed us also his
wife’s house-pet, an immense white crane, his big crop of
peaches, his old fig-tree, thirty feet in diameter of shade, and
to his wish of “bon voyage” added for each a bouquet of the
jessamines we were admiring. The homes were homes, not
settlements on speculation; the house, sometimes of logs, it
is true, but hereditary logs, and more often of smooth lumber,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
with deep and spreading galleries on all sides for the coolest
comfort. For form, all ran or tended to run to a peaked and
many-chimneyed centre, with, here and there, a suggestion of
a dormar window. Not all were provided with figs and jessamines,
but each had some inclosure betraying good intentions.</p>

<p>The monotonous landscape did not invite to loitering, and
we passed but three nights in houses by the road. The first
was that of an old Italian-French emigrant, known as “Old
Man Corse.” He had a name of his own, which he recalled
for us, but in forty years it had been lost and superseded by
this designation, derived from his birth-place, the island of
Corsica. This mixture of nationalities in language must be
breeding for future antiquaries a good deal of amusing labour.
Next day we were recommended to stop at Jack Bacon’s,
and, although we would have preferred to avoid an American’s,
did so rather than go further, and found our Jack
Bacon a Creole, named Jacques Béguin. This is equal to
Tuckapaw and Nakitosh, the general pronunciation of Attakapas
and Nachitoches.</p>

<p>The house of Old Man Corse stood in the shade of oaks,
figs, and cypresses, upon the bank of a little bayou, looking
out upon the broad prairie. It was large and comfortable,
with wide galleries and dormar windows, supported by a
negro-hut and a stable. Ornamental axe-work and rude
decorative joinery were abundant. The roof was of large
split shingles, much warped in the sun. As we entered and
took seats by the fire, the room reminded us, with its big
fire-place, and old smoke-stained and time-toned cypress
beams and ceiling, and its rude but comfortable aspect, of the
Acadian fireside:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="i9">“In doors, warm by the wide-mouthed fire-place, idly the farmer</p>
    <p>Sat in his elbow-chair, and watched how the flames and the smoke-wreaths</p>
    <p>Struggled together, like foes in a burning city. Behind him,</p>
    <p>Nodding and mocking along the wall, with gestures fantastic,</p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
    <p>Darted his own huge shadow, and vanished away into darkness,</p>
    <p>Faces, clumsily carved in oak, on the back of his arm-chair,</p>
    <p>Laughed in the flickering light, and the pewter plates on the dresser</p>
    <p>Caught and reflected the flame, as shields of armies the sunshine.”</p>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The tall, elderly, busy housewife bustled about with preparations
for supper, while we learned that they had been
settled here forty years, and had never had reason to regret
their emigration. The old man had learnt French, but no
English. The woman could speak some “American,” as she
properly termed it. Asking her about musquitoes, we received
a reply in French, that they were more abundant
some years than others; then, as no quantitative adjective of
sufficient force occurred to her, she added, “Three years ago,
oh! heaps of musquitoes, sir, <i>heaps</i>! worse as now.”</p>

<p>She laid the table to the last item, and prepared everything
nicely, but called a negro girl to wait upon us. The girl
stood quiet behind us, the mistress helping us, and practically
anticipating all our wants.</p>

<p>The supper was of venison, in ragoût, with a sauce that
savoured of the south of France; there was a side dish of
hominy, a jug of sweet milk, and wheat-bread in loaf—the
first since Houston.</p>

<p>In an evening smoke, upon the settle, we learned that there
were many Creoles about here, most of whom learned English,
and had their children taught English at the schools. The
Americans would not take the trouble to learn French. They
often intermarried. A daughter of their own was the wife of
an American neighbour. We asked if they knew of a distinct
people here called Acadians. Oh yes, they knew many
settled in the vicinity, descended from some nation that came
here in the last century. They had now no peculiarities.
There were but few free negroes just here, but at Opelousas
and Niggerville there were many, some of whom were rich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
and owned slaves, though a part were unmixed black in colour.
They kept pretty much by themselves, not attempting to
enter white society.</p>

<p>As we went to look at our horses, two negroes followed us
to the stable.</p>

<p>“Dat horse a Tennessee horse, mass’r,” said one.</p>

<p>“Yes, he was born in Tennessee.”</p>

<p>“Born in Tennessee and raised by a Dutchman,” said the
other, sotto voce, I suppose, quoting a song.</p>

<p>“Why, were you born in Tennessee?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No, sar, I was born in dis State.”</p>

<p>“How comes it you speak English so much better than
your master?”</p>

<p>“Ho, ho, my old mass’r, he don’ speak it at all; my missus
she speak it better’n my mass’r do, but you see I war raised
on de parara, to der eastward, whar thar’s heaps of ’Mericans;
so I larned it good.”</p>

<p>He spoke it, with a slight accent, while the other, whom
he called Uncle Tom, I observed did not. I asked Uncle
Tom if he was born in the State.</p>

<p>“<i>No, sar!</i> I was born in <i>Varginny</i>! in ole Varginny,
mass’r. I was raised in —— county [in the West]. I was
twenty-two year ole when I came away from thar, and I’ve
been in this country, forty year come next Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Then you are sixty years old.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sar, amos’ sixty. But I’d like to go back to Varginny.
Ho, ho! I ’ould like to go back and live in ole
Varginny, again.”</p>

<p>“Why so? I thought niggers generally liked this country
best—I’ve been told so—because it is so warm here.”</p>

<p>“Ho, ho! it’s mos’ too warm here, sometime, and I can’t
work at my trade here. Sometimes for three months I don’
go in my shop, on’y Sundays to work for mysef.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>“What is your trade?”</p>

<p>“I’m a blacksmith, mass’r. I used to work at blacksmithing
all the time in ole Virginny, ironin’ waggons, and shoein’
horses for the folks that work in the mines. But here, can’t
get nothun’ to do. In this here sile, if you sharpen up a
plough in the spring o’ the year, it’ll last all summer, and
horses don’ want shoeing once a year, here on the parara.
I’ve got a good mass’r here, tho’; the ole man ain’t hard on
his niggers.”</p>

<p>“Was your master hard in Virginia?”</p>

<p>“Well, I wos hired to different mass’rs, sar, thar, afore I
wos sole off. I was sole off to a sheriff’s sale, mass’r: I wos
sole for fifteen hunerd an’ fifty dollars; I fetched that on the
block, cash, I did, and the man as bought me he brung me
down here, and sole me for two thousand two hunerd
dollars.”</p>

<p>“That was a good price; a very high price in those days.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sar, it was that—ho, ho, ho! It was a man by the
name of ——, from Tennessee, what bought me. He made a
business of goin’ roun’ and buyin’ up people, and bringin’ ’em
down here, speculatin’ on ’em. Ho, ho! he did well that
time. But I’d ’a’ liked it better, for all that, to have stayed
in ole Varginny. ’Tain’t the heat, tho’ it’s too hot here
sometimes; but you know, sar, I was born and raised in Varginny,
and seems like ’twould be pleasanter to live thar. It’s
kinder natural to people to hanker arter the place they wos
raised in. Ho, ho! I’d like it a heap better, tho’ this ole
man’s a good mass’r; never had no better mass’r.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you became a Catholic after you got here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sar” (hesitatingly).</p>

<p>“I suppose all the people are Catholics here?”</p>

<p>“Here? Oh, no, sar; they was whar I wos first in this
here country; they wos all Catholics there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>“Well, they are all Catholics here, too—ain’t they?”</p>

<p>“Here, sar? Here, sar? Oh, no, sar!”</p>

<p>“Why, your master is not a Protestant, is he?”</p>

<p>After two deep groans, he replied in a whisper:</p>

<p>“Oh, sar, they don’ have no meetin’ o’ no kind, roun’
here!”</p>

<p>“There are a good many free negroes in this country,
ain’t there?”</p>

<p>“What! here, sar? Oh, no, sar; no such good luck as
that in this country.”</p>

<p>“At Opelousas, I understood, there were a good many.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but them wos born free, sar, under old Spain, sar.”</p>

<p>“Yes, those I mean.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, there’s lots o’ <i>them</i>; some of ’em rich, and
some of ’em—a good many of ’em—goes to the penitentiary—you
know what that is. White folks goes to the penitenti’ry,
too—ho! ho!—sometimes.”</p>

<p>“I have understood many of them were quite rich.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, o’ course they is: they started free, and ain’t
got nobody to work for but theirselves; of course they
gets rich. Some of ’em owns slaves—heaps of ’em. That
ar ain’t right.”</p>

<p>“Not right! why not?”</p>

<p>“Why, you don’ think it’s right for one nigger to own
another nigger! One nigger’s no business to sarve another.
It’s bad enough to have to sarve a white man without being
paid for it, without having to sarve a black man.”</p>

<p>“Don’t they treat their slaves well?”</p>

<p>“No, sar, they don’t. There ain’t no nations so bad
masters to niggers as them free niggers, though there’s some,
I’ve heard, wos very kind; but—I wouldn’t sarve ’em if they
wos—no!—Does you live in Tennessee, mass’r?”</p>

<p>“No—in New York.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“There’s heaps of Quakers in New York, ain’t there,
mass’r?”</p>

<p>“No—not many.”</p>

<p>“I’ve always heard there was.”</p>

<p>“In Philadelphia there are a good many.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! in Philadelphia, and in Winchester, and in
New Jarsey. I know—ho! ho! I’ve been in those countries,
and I’ve seen ’em. I wos raised nigh by Winchester,
and I’ve been all about there. Used to iron waggons and
shoe horses in that country. Dar’s a road from Winchester
to Philadelphia—right straight. Quakers all along. Right
good people, dem Quakers—ho! ho!—I know.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>We slept in well-barred beds, and awoke long after sunrise.
As soon as we were stirring, black coffee was sent into
us, and at breakfast we had <i>café au lait</i> in immense bowls
in the style of the <i>crêmeries</i> of Paris. The woman remarked
that our dog had slept in their bed-room. They had taken
our saddle-bags and blankets with them for security, and
Judy had insisted on following them. “Dishonest black
people might come here and get into the room,” explained
the old man. “Yes; and some of our own people in the
house might come to them. Such things have happened
here, and you never can trust any of them,” said the woman,
her own black girl behind her chair.</p>

<p>At Mr. Béguin’s (Bacon’s) we stopped on a Saturday
night: and I was obliged to feed my own horse in the morning,
the negroes having all gone off before daylight. The
proprietor was a Creole farmer, owning a number of labourers,
and living in comfort. The house was of the ordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
Southern double-cabined style, the people speaking English,
intelligent, lively, and polite, giving us good entertainment at
the usual price. At a rude corn-mill belonging to Mr.
Béguin, we had noticed among the negroes an Indian boy, in
negro clothing, and about the house were two other Indians—an
old man and a young man; the first poorly clad, the
other gaily dressed in a showy printed calico frock, and
worked buckskin leggings, with beads and tinsel ornaments, a
great turban of Scotch shawl-stuff on his head. It appeared
they were Choctaws, of whom a good many lived in the
neighbourhood. The two were hired for farm labour at three
bits (37½ cents) a day. The old man had a field of his own,
in which stood handsome corn. Some of them were industrious,
but none were steady at work—often refusing to go
on, or absenting themselves from freaks. I asked about the
boy at the mill. He lived there and did work, getting no
wages, but “living there with the niggers.” They seldom
consort; our host knew but one case in which a negro had an
Indian wife.</p>

<p>At Lake Charles we had seen a troop of Alabamas, riding
through the town with baskets and dressed deerskins for sale.
They were decked with feathers, and dressed more showily
than the Choctaws, but in calico: and over their heads, on
horseback—curious progress of manners—all carried open,
black cotton <i>umbrellas</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Our last night in this region was spent in a house which
we reached at sundown of a Sunday afternoon. It proved to
be a mere cottage, in a style which has grown to be common
along our road. The walls are low, of timber and mud; the
roof, high, and sloping from a short ridge in all directions;
and the chimney of sticks and mud. The space is divided
into one long living-room, having a kitchen at one end and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
bed-room at the other. As we rode up, we found only a
little boy, who answered us in French. His mother was
milking, and his father out in the field.</p>

<p>We rode on to the fence of the field, which enclosed twenty
acres, planted in cotton, corn, and sweet potatoes, and waited
until the proprietor reached us and the end of his furrow.
He stopped before replying, to unhitch his horse, then gave
consent to our staying in his house, and we followed his lead
to the yard, where we unsaddled our horses. He was a tall,
stalwart man in figure, with a large intellectual head, but as
uninformed, we afterwards discovered, as any European peasant;
though he wore, as it were, an ill-fitting dress of rude independence
in manner, such as characterises the Western man.</p>

<p>The field was well cultivated, and showed the best corn we
had seen east of the Brazos. Three negro men and two
women were at work, and continued hoeing until sunset.
They were hired, it appeared, by the proprietor, at four bits
(fifty cents) a day. He was in the habit of making use of
the Sundays of the slaves of the neighbourhood in this way,
paying them sometimes seventy-five cents a day.</p>

<p>On entering the house, we were met by two young boys,
gentle and winning in manner, coming up of their own accord
to offer us their hands. They were immediately set to work
by their father at grinding corn, in the steel-mill, for supper.
The task seemed their usual one, yet very much too severe for
their strength, as they were slightly built, and not over ten
years old. Taking hold at opposite sides of the winch, they
ground away, outside the door, for more than an hour, constantly
stopping to take breath, and spurred on by the voice
of the papa, if the delay were long.</p>

<p>They spoke only French, though understanding questions
in English. The man and his wife—an energetic but worn
woman—spoke French or English indifferently, even to one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
another, changing, often, in a single sentence. He could not
tell us which was his mother tongue; he had always been as
much accustomed to the one as to the other. He said he
was not a Frenchman, but a native, American-born; but
afterwards called himself a “Dutch-American,” a phrase he
was unable to explain. He informed us that there were many
“Dutch-French” here, that is, people who were Dutch, but
who spoke French.</p>

<p>The room into which we were ushered, was actually without
an article of furniture. The floor was of boards, while
those of the other two rooms were of trodden clay. The
mud-walls had no other relief than the mantel, on which
stood a Connecticut clock, two small mirrors, three or four
cheap cups and saucers, and a paste brooch in the form of a
cross, pinned upon paper, as in a jeweller’s shop. Chairs
were brought in from the kitchen, having deer-hide seats,
from which sprang forth an atrocious number of fresh fleas.</p>

<p>We had two or three hours to wait for our late supper, and
thus more than ample time to converse with our host, who
proceeded to twist and light a shuck cigar. He made, he
said, a little cotton, which he hauled ten miles to be ginned
and baled. For this service he paid seventy-five cents a
hundred weight, in which the cost of bagging was not included.
The planter who baled it, also sold it for him, sending
it, with his own, to a factor in New Orleans, by steamboat
from Niggerville, just beyond Opelousas. Beside cotton, he
sold every year some beef cattle. He had a good many cows,
but didn’t exactly know how many. Corn, too, he sometimes
sold, but only to neighbours, who had not raised enough for
themselves. It would not pay to haul it to any market.
The same applied to sweet potatoes, which were considered
worth seventy-five cents a barrel.</p>

<p>The “range” was much poorer than formerly. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
crowded, and people would have to take their stock somewhere
else in four or five years more, or they would starve. He
didn’t know what was going to become of poor folks, rich
people were taking up the public land so fast, induced by the
proposed railroad to New Orleans.</p>

<p>More or less stock was always starved in winter. The
worst time for them was when a black gnat, called the “eye-breaker,”
comes out. This insect breeds in the low woodlands,
and when a freshet occurs in winter is driven out in
swarms upon the prairies, attacking cattle terribly. They
were worse than all manner of musquitoes, flies, or other insects.
Cattle would herd together then, and wander wildly
about, not looking for the best feed, and many would get
killed. But this did not often happen.</p>

<p>Horses and cattle had degenerated much within his recollection.
No pains were taken to improve breeds. People,
now-a-days, had got proud, and when they had a fine colt
would break him for a carriage or riding-horse, leaving only
the common scurvy sort to run with the mares. This was
confirmed by our observation, the horses about here being
wretched in appearance, and the grass short and coarse.</p>

<p>When we asked to wash before supper, a shallow cake-pan
was brought and set upon the window-seat, and a mere rag
offered us for towel. Upon the supper-table, we found two
wash-bowls, one filled with milk, the other with molasses.
We asked for water, which was given us in one battered tin
cup. The dishes, besides the bacon and bread, were fried
eggs and sweet potatoes. The bowl of molasses stood in the
centre of the table, and we were pressed to partake of it, as
the family did, by dipping in it bits of bread. But how it
was expected to be used at breakfast, when we had bacon and
potatoes, with spoons, but no bread, I cannot imagine, the
family not breakfasting with us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>The night was warm, and musquitoes swarmed, but we
carried with us a portable tent-shaped bar, which we hung
over the feather bed, upon the floor, and rested soundly amid
their mad singing.</p>

<p>The distance to Opelousas, our Frenchman told us, was
fifteen miles by the road, though only ten miles in a direct
line. We found it lined with farms, whose division-fences the
road always followed, frequently changing its course in so
doing at a right angle. The country was very wet and unattractive.
About five miles from the town, begin plantations
on an extensive scale, upon better soil, and here were large
gangs of negroes at work upon cotton, with their hoes.</p>

<p>At the outskirts of the town, we waded the last pool, and
entered, with a good deal of satisfaction, the peaceful shaded
streets. Reaching the hotel, we were not so instantly struck
as perhaps we should have been, with the overwhelming advantages
of civilization, which sat in the form of a landlord,
slapping with an agate-headed, pliable cane, his patent leather
boots, poised, at easy height, upon one of the columns of
the gallery. We were suffered to take off our saddle-bags,
and to wait until waiting was no longer a pleasure, before
civilization, wringing his cane against the floor, but not removing
his cigar, brought his patent leathers to our vicinity.</p>

<p>After some conversation, intended as animated upon one
side and ineffably indifferent on the other, our horses obtained
notice from that exquisitely vague eye, but a further introduction
was required before our persons became less than transparent,
for the boots walked away, and became again a subject
of contemplation upon the column, leaving us, with our
saddle-bags, upon the steps. After inquiring, of a bystander
if this glossy individual were the actual landlord, we attacked
him in a tone likely to produce either a revolver-shot or a
room, but whose effect was to obtain a removal of the cigar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
and a gentle survey, ending in a call for a boy to show the
gentlemen to number thirteen.</p>

<p>After an hour’s delay, we procured water, and were about
to enjoy very necessary ablutions, when we observed that the
door of our room was partly of uncurtained glass. A shirt
was pinned to this, and ceremonies were about beginning,
when a step came down the passage, and a gentleman put his
hand through a broken pane, and lifted the obstruction, wishing
“to see what was going on so damn’d secret in number thirteen.”
When I walked toward him hurriedly, <i>in puris
naturalibus</i>, he drew hastily and entered the next room.</p>

<p>On the gallery of the hotel, after dinner, a fine-looking man—who
was on the best of terms with every one—familiar with
the judge—and who had been particularly polite to me, at the
dinner-table, said to another:</p>

<p>“I hear you were very unlucky with that girl you bought
of me, last year?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was; very unlucky. She died with her first child,
and the child died, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, that was right hard for you. She was a fine girl.
I don’t reckon you lost less than five thousand dollars, when
she died.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not a dollar less.”</p>

<p>“Well, it came right hard upon you—just beginning so.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was foolish, I suppose, to risk so much on the life
of a single woman; but I’ve got a good start again now,
for all that. I’ve got two right likely girls; one of them’s
got a fine boy, four months old, and the other’s with child—and
old Pine Knot’s as hearty as ever.”</p>

<p>“Is he? Hasn’t been sick at all, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he was sick very soon after I bought him of you;
but he got well soon.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. I’d rather a nigger would be sick early,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
after he comes into this country; for he’s bound to be acclimated,
sooner or later, and the longer it’s put off, the harder
it goes with him.”</p>

<p>The man was a regular negro trader. He told me that he
had a partner in Kentucky, and that they owned a farm
there, and another one here. His partner bought negroes, as
opportunity offered to get them advantageously, and kept them
on their Kentucky farm; and he went on occasionally, and
brought the surplus to their Louisiana plantation—where he
held them for sale.</p>

<p>“So-and-so is very hard upon you,” said another man, to
him as he still sat, smoking his cigar, on the gallery, after
dinner.</p>

<p>“Why so? He’s no business to complain; I told him just
exactly what the nigger was, before I sold him (laughing, as
if there was a concealed joke). It was all right—all right.
I heard that he sold him again for a thousand dollars; and
the people that bought him, gave him two hundred dollars to
let them off from the bargain. I’m sure he can’t complain of
me. It was a fair transaction. He knew just what he was
buying.”</p>

<p>An intelligent man whom I met here, and who had been
travelling most of the time during the last two years in
Louisiana, having business with the planters, described the
condition of the new slaveholders and the poorer planters as
being very miserable.</p>

<p>He had sometimes found it difficult to get food, even when
he was in urgent need of it, at their houses. The lowest
class live much from hand to mouth, and are often in
extreme destitution. This was more particularly the case
with those who lived on the rivers; those who resided on the
prairies were seldom so much reduced. The former now live
only on those parts of the river to which the back-swamp approaches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
nearest; that is, where there is but little valuable
land, that can be appropriated for plantation-purposes. They
almost all reside in communities, very closely housed in poor
cabins. If there is any considerable number of them, there is
to be always found, among the cluster of their cabins, a
church, and a billiard and a gambling-room—and the latter is
always occupied, and play going on.</p>

<p>They almost all appear excessively apathetic, sleepy, and
stupid, if you see them at home; and they are always longing
and waiting for some excitement. They live for excitement,
and will not labour, unless it is violently, for a short time, to
gratify some passion.</p>

<p>This was as much the case with the women as the men.
The women were often handsome, stately, and graceful, and,
ordinarily, exceedingly kind; but languid, and incredibly
indolent, unless there was a ball, or some other excitement, to
engage them. Under excitement, they were splendidly animated,
impetuous, and eccentric. One moment they seemed
possessed by a devil, and the next by an angel.</p>

<p>The Creoles<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> are inveterate gamblers—rich and poor alike.
The majority of wealthy Creoles, he said, do nothing to
improve their estate; and are very apt to live beyond their
income. They borrow and play, and keep borrowing to play,
as long as they can; but they will not part with their land,
and especially with their home, as long as they can help it, by
any sacrifice.</p>

<p>The men are generally dissolute. They have large families,
and a great deal of family affection. He did not know that
they had more than Anglo-Saxons; but they certainly manifested
a great deal more, and, he thought, had more domestic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
happiness. If a Creole farmer’s child marries, he will build
a house for the new couple, adjoining his own; and when
another marries, he builds another house—so, often his whole
front on the river is at length occupied. Then he begins to
build others, back of the first—and so, there gradually forms
a little village, wherever there is a large Creole family,
owning any considerable piece of land. The children are
poorly educated, and are not brought up to industry, at all.</p>

<p>The planters living near them, as their needs increase, lend
them money, and get mortgages on their land, or, in some
way or other, if it is of any value, force them to part
with it. Thus they are every year reduced, more and more,
to the poorest lands; and the majority now are able to get but
a very poor living, and would not be able to live at all in a
Northern climate. They are nevertheless—even the poorest
of them—habitually gay and careless, as well as kind-hearted,
hospitable, and dissolute—working little, and spending much
of their time at church, or at balls, or the gaming-table.</p>

<p>There are very many wealthy Creole planters, who are as
cultivated and intelligent as the better class of American
planters, and usually more refined. The Creoles, he said, did
not work their slaves as hard as the Americans; but, on the
other hand, they did not feed or clothe them nearly as well,
and he had noticed universally, on the Creole plantations, a
large number of “used-up hands”—slaves, sore and crippled,
or invalided for some cause. On all sugar plantations, he
said, they work the negroes excessively, in the grinding
season; often cruelly. Under the usual system, to keep the
fires burning, and the works constantly supplied, eighteen
hours’ work was required of every negro, in twenty-four—leaving
but six for rest. The work of most of them, too, was
very hard. They were generally, during the grinding season,
liberally supplied with food and coffee, and were induced, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
much as possible, to make a kind of frolic of it; yet, on the
Creole plantations, he thought they did not, even in the
grinding season, often get meat.</p>

<p>I remarked that the law, in Louisiana, required that meat
should be regularly served to the negroes.</p>

<p>“O, those laws are very little regarded.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Suppose you are my neighbour; if you
maltreat your negroes, and tell me of it, or I see it, am I
going to prefer charges against you to the magistrates? I
might possibly get you punished according to law; but if I
did, or did not, I should have you, and your family and
friends, far and near, for my mortal enemies. There is a law
of the State that negroes shall not be worked on Sundays;
but I have seen negroes at work almost every Sunday, when I
have been in the country, since I have lived in Louisiana.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I
spent a Sunday once with a gentleman, who did not work
his hands at all on Sunday, even in the grinding season; and
he had got some of his neighbours to help him build a
school-house, which was used as a church on Sunday. He
said, there was not a plantation on either side of him, as far
as he could see, where the slaves were not generally worked
on Sunday; but that, after the church was started, several of
them quit the practice, and made their negroes go to the
meeting. This made others discontented; and after a year or
two, the planters voted new trustees to the school, and these
forbid the house to be used for any other than school purposes.
This was done, he had no doubt, for the purpose of breaking
up the meetings, and to lessen the discontent of the slaves
which were worked on Sunday.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>
<p>It was said that the custom of working the negroes on
Sunday was much less common than formerly; if so, he
thought that it must have formerly been universal.</p>

<p>He had lived, when a boy, for several years on a farm in
Western New York, and afterwards, for some time, at Rochester,
and was well acquainted with the people generally, in
the valley of the Genesee.</p>

<p>I asked him if he thought, among the intelligent class of
farmers and planters, people of equal property lived more
happily in New York or Louisiana. He replied immediately,
as if he had carefully considered the topic, that, with some
rare exceptions, farmers worth forty thousand dollars lived
in far greater comfort, and enjoyed more refined and elegant
leisure, than planters worth three hundred thousand, and
that farmers of the ordinary class, who laboured with their
own hands, and were worth some six thousand dollars, in the
Genesee valley, lived in far greater comfort, and in all respects
more enviably, than planters worth forty thousand dollars
in Louisiana. The contrast was especially favourable to
the New York farmer, in respect to books and newspapers.
He might travel several days, and call on a hundred planters,
and hardly see in their houses more than a single newspaper
a-piece, in most cases; perhaps none at all: nor any books,
except a Bible, and some government publications, that had
been franked to them through the post-office, and perhaps a
few religious tracts or school-books.</p>

<p>The most striking difference that he observed between
the Anglo-Americans of Louisiana and New York, was the
impulsive and unreflective habit of the former, in doing
business. He mentioned, as illustrative of this, the almost
universal passion among the planters for increasing their
negro-stock. It appeared evident to him, that the market
price of negroes was much higher than the prices of cotton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
and sugar warranted; but it seemed as if no planter ever
made any calculation of that kind. The majority of planters,
he thought, would always run in debt to the extent of their credit
for negroes, whatever was asked for them, without making any
calculation of the reasonable prospects of their being able to
pay their debts. When any one made a good crop, he would
always expect that his next one would be better, and make
purchases in advance upon such expectation. When they were
dunned, they would attribute their inability to pay, to accidental
short crops, and always were going ahead risking
everything, in confidence that another year of luck would favour
them, and a big crop make all right.</p>

<p>If they had a full crop, probably there would be good crops
everywhere else, and prices would fall, and then they would
whine and complain, as if the merchants were to blame for
it, and would insinuate that no one could be expected to pay
his debts when prices <b>were</b> so low, and that it would be
dangerous to press such an unjust claim. And, if the crops
met with any misfortune, from floods, or rot, or vermin, they
would cry about it like children when rain fell upon a holiday,
as if they had never thought of the possibility of such a
thing, and were very hard used.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>
<p>He had talked with many sugar-planters who were strong
Cuba war and annexation men, and had rarely found that any
of these had given the first thought to the probable effect the
annexation of Cuba would have on their home interests. It
was mainly a romantic excitement and enthusiasm, inflamed
by senseless appeals to their patriotism and their combativeness.
They had got the idea, that patriotism was necessarily
associated with hatred and contempt of any other country but
their own, and the only foreigners to be regarded with favour
were those who desired to surrender themselves to us. They
did not reflect that the annexation of Cuba would necessarily
be attended by the removal of the duty on sugar, and would
bring them into competition with the sugar-planters of that
island, where the advantages for growing cane were so much
greater than in Louisiana.</p>

<p>To some of the very wealthy planters who favoured the
movement, and who were understood to have taken some of
the Junta<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> stock, he gave credit for greater sagacity. He
thought it was the purpose of these men, if Cuba could be
annexed, to get possession of large estates there: then, with
the advantages of their greater skill in sugar-making, and
better machinery than that which yet was in use in Cuba,
and with much cheaper land and labour, and a far better
climate for cane growing than that of Louisiana, it would be
easy for them to accumulate large fortunes in a few years;
but he thought the sugar-planters who remained in Louisiana
would be ruined by it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>
<p>The principal subscribers to the Junta stock at the South,
he thought, were land speculators; persons who expected that,
by now favouring the movement, they would be able to obtain
from the revolutionary government large grants of land in
the island as gratuities in reward of their services or at nominal
prices, which after annexation would rise rapidly in value;
or persons who now owned wild land in the States, and who
thought that if Cuba were annexed the African slave-trade
would be re-established, either openly or clandestinely, with
the States, and their lands be increased in value, by the
greater cheapness with which they could then be stocked with
labourers.</p>

<p>I find these views confirmed in a published letter from a
Louisiana planter, to one of the members of Congress, from
that State; and I insert an extract of that letter, as it is evidently
from a sensible and far-thinking man, to show on
how insecure a basis rests the prosperity of the slave-holding
interest in Louisiana. The fact would seem to be, that, if it
were not for the tariff on foreign sugars, sugar could not be
produced at all by slave-labour; and that a discontinuance of
sugar culture would almost desolate the State.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The question now naturally comes up to you and to me, Do we
Louisianians desire the possession of Cuba? It is not what the provision
dealers of the West, or the shipowners of the North may wish for, but
what the State of Louisiana, as a State, may deem consistent with her
best interests. My own opinion on the subject is not a new one. It was
long ago expressed to high officers of our Government, neither of whom
ever hesitated to acknowledge that it was, in the main, correct. That
opinion was and is, <i>that the acquisition of Cuba would prove the ruin of our
State</i>. I found this opinion on the following reasons: Cuba has already
land enough in cultivation to produce, when directed by American skill,
energy, and capital, twenty millions of tons of sugar. In addition to this
she has virgin soil, only needing roads to bring it, with a people of the
least pretension to enterprise, into active working, sufficient nearly to
double this; all of which would be soon brought into productiveness were
it our own, with the whole American market free to it. If any man supposes
that the culture of sugar in our State can be sustained in the face of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
this, I have only to say that he can suppose anything. We have very
nearly, if not quite, eighty millions invested in the sugar culture. My
idea is that <i>three-fourths of this would, so far as the State is concerned, be
annihilated at a blow</i>. The planter who is in debt, would find his negroes
and machinery sold and despatched to Cuba for him, and he who is independent
would go there in self-defence. What will become of the other
portion of the capital? It consists of land, on which I maintain there can
be produced no other crop but sugar, under present auspices, that will
bear the contest with cocoa,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and the expense and risk of levees, as it
regards the larger part of it, and the difficulty of transportation for the
remainder. But supposing that it will be taken up by some other cultivation,
that in any case must be a work of time, and in this case a very long
time for unacclimated men. It is not unreasonable, then, to suppose that
this whole capital will, for purposes of taxation, be withdrawn from
Louisiana. From whence, then, is to come the revenue for the support
of our State government, for the payment of the interest on our debt, and
the eventual redemption of the principal? Perhaps repudiation may be
recommended; but you and I, my dear sir, are too old-fashioned to rob in
that manner, or in any other. The only resort, then, is double taxation
on the cotton planter, which will drive him, without much difficulty, to
Texas, to Arkansas, and Mississippi.”</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Washington.</i>—The inn, here, when we arrived, was well
filled with guests, and my friend and I were told that we
must sleep together. In the room containing our bed there
were three other beds; and although the outside of the house
was pierced with windows, nowhere more than four feet apart,
not one of them opened out of our room. A door opened
into the hall, another into the dining-room, and at the side of
our bed was a window into the dining-room, through which,
betimes in the morning, we could, with our heads on our
pillows, see the girls setting the breakfast-tables. Both the
doors were provided with glass windows, without curtains.
Hither, about eleven o’clock, we “retired.” Soon afterwards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
hearing something moving under the bed, I asked, “Who’s
there?” and was answered by a girl, who was burrowing for
eggs; part of the stores of the establishment being kept in
boxes, in this convenient locality. Later, I was awakened by
a stranger attempting to enter my bed. I expostulated, and
he replied that it was his bed, and nobody else had a right to
his place in it. Who was I, he asked, angrily, and where
was his partner? “Here I am,” answered a voice from
another bed; and without another word, he left us. I slept
but little, and woke feverish, and with a headache, caused by
the want of ventilation.</p>

<p>While at the dinner-table, a man asked, as one might at
the North, if the steamer had arrived, if there had been “any
fights to-day?” After dinner, while we were sitting on the
gallery, loud cursing, and threatening voices were heard in
the direction of the bar-room, which, as at Nachitoches, was
detached, and at a little distance from the hotel. The company,
except myself and the other New-Yorker, immediately ran
towards it. After ten minutes, one returned, and said—</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there’ll be any fight; they are both
cowards.”</p>

<p>“Are they preparing for a fight?”</p>

<p>“O, yes; they are loading pistols in the coffee-room, and
there’s a man outside, in the street, who has a revolver and a
knife, and who is challenging another to come out. He
swears he’ll wait there till he does come out; but in my
opinion he’ll think better of it, when he finds that the other
feller’s got pistols, too.”</p>

<p>“What’s the occasion of the quarrel?”</p>

<p>“Why, the man in the street says the other one insulted
him this morning, and that he had his hand on his knife, at
the very moment he did so, so he couldn’t reply. And now
he says he’s ready to talk with him, and he wants to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
him come out, and as many of his friends as are a mind to,
may come with him; he’s got enough for all of ’em, he says.
He’s got two revolvers, I believe.”</p>

<p>We did not hear how it ended; but, about an hour afterwards,
I saw three men, with pistols in their hands, coming
from the bar-room.</p>

<p>The next day, I saw, in the streets of the same town, two
boys running from another, who was pursuing them with a
large, open dirk-knife in his hand, and every appearance of
ungovernable rage in his face.</p>

<p>The boat, for which I was waiting, not arriving, I asked
the landlady—who appeared to be a German Jewess—if I
could not have a better sleeping-room. She showed me one,
which she said I might use for a single night; but, if I
remained another, I must not refuse to give it up. It had
been occupied by another gentleman, and she thought he
might return the next day, and would want it again; and, if
I remained in it, he would be very angry that they had not
reserved it for him, although they were under no obligation
to him. “He is a dangerous man,” she observed, “and my
husband, he’s a quick-tempered man, and, if they get to
quarrelling about it, ther’ll be knives about, sure. It always
frightens me to see knives drawn.”</p>

<p>A Texas drover, who stayed over night at the hotel, being
asked, as he was about to leave in the morning, if he was not
going to have his horse shod, replied:</p>

<p>“No sir! it’ll be a damn’d long spell ’fore I pay for having
a horse shod. I reckon, if God Almighty had thought it right
hosses should have iron on thar feet, he’d a put it thar
himself. I don’t pretend to be a pious man myself; but I
a’nt a-goin’ to run agin the will of God Almighty, though
thar’s some, that calls themselves ministers of Christ, that
does it.”</p>

<span class="s08">A TRIP INTO NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI.</span></h2>

<p><i>Vicksburg, March 18th.</i>—I arrived at this place last night,
about sunset, and was told that there was no hotel in the
town except on the wharf-boat, the only house used for that
purpose having been closed a few days ago on account of
a difference of opinion between its owner and his tenant.</p>

<p>There are no wharves on the Mississippi, or any of the
southern rivers. The wharf-boat is an old steamboat, with
her paddle boxes and machinery removed and otherwise dismantled,
on which steamboats discharge passengers and
freight. The main deck is used as a warehouse, and, in place
of the furnace, has in this case a dram shop, a chandler’s
shop, a forwarding agency, and a telegraph office. Overhead,
the saloon and state-rooms remain, and with the bar-room and
clerk’s office, kitchen and barber’s shop, constitute a stationary
though floating hostelry.</p>

<p>Though there were fifty or more rooms, and not a dozen
guests, I was obliged, about twelve o’clock, to admit a
stranger who had been gambling all the evening in the
saloon, to occupy the spare shelf of my closet. If a disposition
to enjoy occasional privacy, or to exercise a choice in one’s
room-mates were a sure symptom of a monomania for incendiarism,
it could not be more carefully thwarted than it is at
all public-houses in this part of the world.</p>

<p><i>Memphis, March 20th.</i>—I reached this place to-day in
forty-eight horns by steamboat from Vicksburg.</p>

<p>Here, at the “Commercial Hotel,” I am favoured with an
unusually good-natured room-mate. He is smoking on the
bed—our bed—now, and wants to know what my business is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
here, and whether I carry a pistol about me; also whether I
believe that it isn’t lucky to play cards on Sundays; which I
do most strenuously, especially as this is a rainy Sunday, and
his second cigar is nearly smoked out.</p>

<p>This is a first-class hotel, and has, of course, printed bills of
fare, which, in a dearth of other literature, are not to be
dropped at the first glance. A copy of to-day’s is presented
on the opposite page.</p>

<p>Being in a distant quarter of the establishment when a
crash of the gong announced dinner, I did not get to the
table as early as some others. The meal was served in a
large, dreary room exactly like a hospital ward; and it is a
striking illustration of the celerity with which everything is
accomplished in our young country, that beginning with the
soup, and going on by the fish to the roasts, the first five
dishes I inquired for—when at last I succeeded in arresting
one of the negro boys—were “all gone;” and as the waiter
had to go to the head of the dining-room, or to the kitchen,
to ascertain this fact upon each demand, the majority of the
company had left the table before I was served at all. At
length I said I would take anything that was still to be had,
and thereupon was provided immediately with some grimy
bacon, and greasy cabbage. This I commenced eating, but I
no sooner paused for a moment, than it was suddenly and
surreptitiously removed, and its place supplied, without the
expression of any desire on my part, with some other Memphitic
chef d’œuvre, a close investigation of which left me in
doubt whether it was that denominated “sliced potatoe pie,”
or “Irish pudding.”</p>

<p>I congratulate myself that I have lived to see the day
in which an agitation for reform in our <span class="allsmcap">GREAT HOTEL SYSTEM</span>
has been commenced, and I trust that a Society for the
Revival of Village Inns will ere long form one of the features
of the May anniversaries.</p>

<p>A stage-coach conveyed the railroad passengers from the
hotel to the station, which was a mile or two out of town.
As we were entering the coach the driver observed with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
Mephistophelean smile that we “needn’t calk’late we were
gwine to ride very fur,” and, as soon as we had got into the
country he stopped and asked all the men to get out and
walk, for, he condescended to explain, “it was as much as
his hosses could do to draw the ladies and the baggage.” It
was quite true; the horses were often obliged to stop, even
with the diminished load, and as there was a contract between
myself and the proprietors by which, for a stipulated sum of
money by me to them in hand duly paid, they had undertaken
to convey me over this ground, I thought it would have
been no more than honest if they had looked out beforehand
to have either a stronger team, or a better road, provided.
As is the custom of our country, however, we allowed ourselves
to be thus robbed with great good-nature, and waded
along ankle-deep in the mud, joking with the driver and
ready to put our shoulders to the wheels if it should be
necessary. Two portmanteaus were jerked off in heavy
lurches of the coach; the owners picked them up and carried
them on their shoulders till the horses stopped to breathe
again. The train of course had waited for us, and it continued
to wait until another coach arrived, when it started
twenty minutes behind time.</p>

<p>After some forty miles of rail, nine of us were stowed away
in another stage coach. The road was bad, the weather foul.
We proceeded slowly, were often in imminent danger of being
upset, and once were all obliged to get out and help the
horses drag the coach out of a slough; but with smoking, and
the occasional circulation of a small black bottle, and a general
disposition to be as comfortable as circumstances would
allow, four hours of coaching proved less fatiguing than one
of the ill-ventilated rail-cars.</p>

<p>Among the passengers was a “Judge,” resident in the
vicinity, portly, dignified, and well-informed; and a young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
man, who was a personal friend of the member of Congress
from the district, and who, as he informed me, had, through
the influence of this friend, a promise from the President of
honourable and lucrative employment under Government.
He was known to all the other passengers, and hailed by
every one on the road-side, by the title of Colonel. The
Judge was ready to converse about the country through
which we were passing, and while perfectly aware, as no one
else seemed to be, that it bore anything but an appearance of
prosperity or attractiveness to a stranger, he assured me that
it was really improving in all respects quite rapidly. There
were few large plantations, but many small planters or rather
farmers, for cotton, though the principal source of cash income,
was much less exclusively an object of attention than in
the more southern parts of the State. A larger space was
occupied by the maize and grain crops. There were not a
few small fields of wheat. In the afternoon, when only the
Colonel and myself were with him, the Judge talked about
slavery in a candid and liberal spirit. At present prices, he
said, nobody could afford to own slaves, unless he could
engage them almost exclusively in cotton-growing. It was
undoubtedly a great injury to a region like this, which was
not altogether well adapted to cotton, to be in the midst of a
slaveholding country, for it prevented efficient free labour.
A good deal of cotton was nevertheless grown hereabouts by
white labour—by poor men who planted an acre or two, and
worked it themselves, getting the planters to gin and press it
for them. It was not at all uncommon for men to begin in
this way and soon purchase negroes on credit, and eventually
become rich men. Most of the plantations in this vicinity,
indeed, belonged to men who had come into the country with
nothing within twenty years. Once a man got a good start
with negroes, unless the luck was much against him, nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
but his own folly could prevent his becoming rich. The
increase of his negro property by births, if he took good care
of it, must, in a few years, make him independent. The
worst thing, and the most difficult to remedy, was the deplorable
ignorance which prevailed. Latterly, however, people
were taking more pride in the education of their children.
Some excellent schools had been established, the teachers
generally from the North, and a great many children were
sent to board in the villages—county-seats—to attend them.
This was especially true of girls, who liked to live in the villages
rather than on the plantations. There was more difficulty in
making boys attend school, until, at least, they were too old
to get much good from it.</p>

<p>The “Colonel” was a rough, merry, good-hearted, simple-minded
man, and kept all the would-be sober-sides of our
coach body in irrepressible laughter with queer observations
on passing occurrences, anecdotes and comic songs. It must
be confessed that there is no charge which the enemies of the
theatre bring against the stage, that was not duly illustrated,
and that with a broadness which the taste of a metropolitan
audience would scarcely permit. Had Doctor —— and
Doctor —— been with me they would thereafter for ever
have denied themselves, and discountenanced in others, the
use of such a means of travel. The Colonel, notwithstanding,
was of a most obliging disposition, and having ascertained
in what direction I was going, enumerated at least a dozen
families on the road, within some hundred miles, whom he
invited me to visit, assuring me that I should find pretty
girls in all of them, and a warm welcome, if I mentioned his
name.</p>

<p>He told the Judge that his bar-bill on the boat, coming up
from New Orleans, was forty dollars—seventeen dollars the
first night. But he had made money—had won forty dollars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
of one gentleman. He confessed, however, that he had lost
fifteen by another, “but he saw how he did it. He did not
want to accuse him publicly, but he saw it and he meant to
write to him and tell him of it. He did not want to insult
the gentleman, only he did not want to have him think that
he was so green as not to know how he did it.”</p>

<p>While stopping for dinner at a village inn, a young man
came into the room where we all were, and asked the coachman
what was to be paid for a trunk which had been brought
for him. The coachman said the charge would be a dollar,
which the young man thought excessive. The coachman
denied that it was so, said that it was what he had often been
paid; he should not take less. The young man finally
agreed to wait for the decision of the proprietor of the line.
There was a woman in the room; I noticed no loud words or
angry tones, and had not supposed that there was the slightest
excitement. I observed, however, that there was a profound
silence for a minute afterwards, which was interrupted
by a jocose remark of the coachman about the delay of our
dinner. Soon after we re-entered the coach, the Colonel
referred to the trunk owner in a contemptuous manner.
The Judge replied in a similar tone. “If I had been
in the driver’s place, I should have killed him sure,”
said the Colonel. With great surprise, I ventured to ask
for what reason. “Did not you see the fellow put his
hand to his breast when the driver denied that he had
ever taken less than a dollar for bringing a trunk from
Memphis?”</p>

<p>“No, I did not; but what of it?”</p>

<p>“Why, he meant to frighten the driver, of course.”</p>

<p>“You think he had a knife in his breast?”</p>

<p>“Of course he had, sir.”</p>

<p>“But you wouldn’t kill him for that, I suppose?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“When a man threatens to kill me, you wouldn’t have me
wait for him to do it, would you, sir?”</p>

<p>The roads continued very heavy; some one remarked,
“There’s been a heap of rain lately,” and rain still kept
falling. We passed a number of cotton waggons which had
stopped in the road; the cattle had been turned out and had
strayed off into the woods, and the drivers lay under the tilts
asleep on straw.</p>

<p>The Colonel said this sight reminded him of his old camp-meeting
days. “I used to be very fond of going to camp-meetings.
I used to go first for fun, and, oh Lord! haint
I had some fun at camp meetings? But after a while I got
a conviction—needn’t laugh, gentlemen. I tell you it was
sober business for me. I’ll never make fun of that. The
truth just is, I am a melancholy case; I thought I was a
pious man once, I did—I’m damn’d if I didn’t. Don’t laugh
at what I say, now; I don’t want fun made of that; I give
you my word I experienced religion, and I used to go to the
meetings with as much sincerity and soberness as anybody
could. That was the time I learned to sing—learned to pray
too, I did; could pray right smart. I did think I was a converted
man, but of course I ain’t, and I ’spose ’twarnt the
right sort, and I don’t reckon I shall have another chance.
A gentleman has a right to make the most of this life, when
he can’t calculate on anything better than roasting in the
next. Aint that so, Judge? I reckon so. You mustn’t
think hard of me, if I do talk wicked some. Can’t help it.”</p>

<p>I was forced by the stage arrangements to travel night and
day. The Colonel told me that I should be able to get a good
supper at a house where the coach was to stop about midnight—“good
honest fried bacon, and hot Christian corn-bread—nothing
like it, to fill a man up and make him feel righteous.
You get a heap better living up in this country than you can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
at the St. Charles, for all the fuss they make about it. It’s
lucky you’ll have something better to travel on to-night than
them French friterzeed Dutch flabbergasted hell-fixins: for
you’ll have the——” (another most extraordinary series of
imprecations on the road over which I was to travel).</p>

<p>Before dark all my companions left me, and in their place
I had but one, a young gentleman with whom I soon became
very intimately acquainted. He was seventeen years old, so
he said; he looked older; and the son of a planter in the
“Yazoo bottoms.” The last year he had “follered overseein’”
on his father’s plantation, but he was bound for Tennessee,
now, to go to an academy, where he could learn geography.
There was a school near home at which he had studied reading
and writing and ciphering, but he thought a gentleman
ought to have some knowledge of geography. At ten o’clock
the next morning the stage-coach having progressed at the
rate of exactly two miles and a half an hour, for the previous
sixteen hours, during which time we had been fasting, the
supper-house, which we should have reached before midnight,
was still ten miles ahead, the driver sulky and refusing to stop
until we reached it. We had been pounded till we ached in
every muscle. I had had no sleep since I left Memphis.
We were passing over a hill country which sometimes appeared
to be quite thickly inhabited, yet mainly still covered with a
pine forest, through which the wind moaned lugubriously.</p>

<p>I had been induced to turn this way in my journey in no
slight degree by reading the following description in a statistical
article of De Bow’s Review:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The settling of this region is one among the many remarkable events
in the history of the rise of the Western States. Fifteen years ago it was
an Indian wilderness, and now it has reached and passed in its population,
other portions of the State of ten times its age, and this population,
too, one of the finest in all the West. Great attention has been given to
schools and education, and here, [at Memphis,] has been located the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
University of Mississippi; so amply endowed by the State, and now just
going into operation under the auspices of some of the ablest professors
from the eastern colleges. There is no overgrown wealth among them,
and yet no squalid poverty; the people being generally comfortable, substantial,
and independent farmers. Considering its climate, soil, wealth,
and general character of its inhabitants, I should think no more desirable
or delightful residence could be found than among the hills and sunny
valleys of the Chickasaw Cession.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>
</div>

<p>And here among the hills of this Paradise of the South-west,
we were, Yazoo and I—he, savagely hungry, as may
be guessed from his observations upon “the finest people of
the West,” among whose cabins in the pine-wood toiled our
stage-coach.</p>

<p>The whole art of driving was directed to the discovery of a
passage for the coach among the trees and through the fields,
where there were fields, adjoining the road—the road itself
being impassable. Occasionally, when the coachman, during
the night, found it necessary, owing to the thickness of the
forest on each side, to take to the road, he would first leave the
coach and make a survey with his lantern, sounding the ruts
of the cotton-waggons, and finally making out a channel by
guiding-stakes which he cut from the underwood with a
hatchet, usually carried in the holster. If, after diligent
sounding, he found no passage sufficiently shallow, he would
sometimes spend half an hour in preparing one, bringing
rails from the nearest fence, or cutting brushwood for the
purpose. We were but once or twice during the night called
upon to leave the coach, or to assist in road-making, and my
companion frequently expressed his gratitude for this—gratitude
not to the driver but to Providence, who had made a
country, as he thought, so unusually well adapted for stage-coaching.
The night before, he had been on a much worse
road, and was half the time, with numerous other passengers,
engaged in bringing rails, and prying the coach out of sloughs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
They had been obliged to keep on the track, because the water
was up over the adjoining country. Where the wooden
causeway had floated off, they had passed through water so
deep that it entered the coach body. With our road of to-day,
then, he could only express satisfaction; not so with the residents
upon it. “Look at ’em!” he would say. “Just look at
’em! What’s the use of such people’s living? ’Pears to me
I’d die if I couldn’t live better ’n that. When I get to be
representative, I’m going to have a law made that all such
kind of men shall be took up by the State and sent to the
penitentiary, to make ’em work and earn something to support
their families. I pity the women; I haint nuthin agin them;
they work hard enough, I know; but the men—I know how
’tis. They just hang around groceries and spend all the money
they can get—just go round and live on other people, and
play keerds, and only go home to nights; and the poor
women, they hev to live how they ken.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it’s so? It is strange we see no men—only
women and children.”</p>

<p>“Tell you they’re off, gettin’ a dinner out o’ somebody.
Tell you I know it’s so. It’s the way all these people do.
Why there’s one poor man I know, that lives in a neighbourhood
of poor men, down our way, and he’s right industrious,
but he can’t get rich and he never ken, cause all these other
poor men live on him.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? Do they all drop in about dinner
time?”</p>

<p>“No, not all on ’em, but some on ’em every day. And
they keep borrowin’ things of him. He haint spunk enough to
insult ’em. If he’d just move into a rich neighborhood and
jest be a little sassy, and not keer so much about what folks
said of him, he’d get rich; never knew a man that was industrious
and sassy in this country that didn’t get rich, quick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
and get niggers to do his work for him. Anybody ken that’s
smart. Thar’s whar they tried to raise some corn. Warn’t
no corn grew thar; that’s sartin. Wonder what they live on?
See the stalks. They never made no corn. Plowed right
down the hill! Did you ever see anything like it? As if
this sile warn’t poor enough already. There now. Just the
same. Only look at ’em! ’Pears like they never see a stage
afore. This ain’t the right road, the way they look at us.
No, sartin, they never see a stage. Lord God! see the
babies. They never see a stage afore. No, the stage never
went by here afore, I know. This damn’d driver’s just taken
us round this way to show off what he can do and pass away
the time before breakfast. Couldn’t get no breakfast here if
he would stop—less we ate a baby. That’s right! step out
where you ken see her good; prehaps you’ll never see a stage
again; better look now, right sharp. Yes, oh yes, sartin;
fetch out all the babies. Haint you got no more? Well, I
should hope not. Now, what is the use of so many babies?
That’s the worst on’t. I’d get married to-morrow if I wasn’t
sure I’d hev babies. I hate babies, can’t bear ’em round me,
and won’t have ’em. I would like to be married. I know
several gals I’d marry if ’twarn’t for that. Well, it’s a fact.
Just so. I hate the squallin’ things. I know I was born a
baby, but I couldn’t help it, could I? I wish I hadn’t been.
I hate the squallin’ things. If I had to hev a baby round me
I should kill it.”</p>

<p>“If you had a baby of your own, you’d feel differently
about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s what they tell me. I s’pose I should, but I don’t
want to feel differently. I hate ’em. I hate ’em.”</p>

<p>The coach stopped at length. We got out and found ourselves
on the bank of an overflowed brook. A part of the
bridge was broken up, the driver declared it impossible to ford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
the stream, and said he should return to the shanty, four
miles back, at which we had last changed horses. We persuaded
him to take one of his horses from the team and let
us see if we could not get across. I succeeded in doing this
without difficulty, and turning the horse loose he returned.
The driver, however, was still afraid to try to ford the stream
with the coach and mails, and after trying our best to persuade
him, I told him if he returned he should do it without
me, hoping he would be shamed out of his pusillanimity.
Yazoo joined me, but the driver having again recovered the
horse upon which he had forded the stream, turned about and
drove back. We pushed on, and after walking a few miles,
came to a neat new house, with a cluster of old cabins about it.
It was much the most comfortable establishment we had seen
during the day. Truly a “sunny valley” home of northern
Mississippi. We entered quietly, and were received by two
women who were spinning in a room with three outside
doors all open, though a fine fire was burning, merely to warm
the room, in a large fire-place, within. Upon our asking if
we could have breakfast prepared for us, one of the women
went to the door and gave orders to a negro, and in a moment
after, we saw six or seven black boys and girls chasing and
clubbing a hen round the yard for our benefit. I regret to
add that they did not succeed in making her tender. At
twelve o’clock we breakfasted, and were then accommodated
with a bed, upon which we slept together for several hours.
When I awoke I walked out to look at the premises.</p>

<p>The house was half a dozen rods from the high road, with
a square yard all about it, in one corner of which was a small
enclosure for stock, and a log stable and corn-crib. There
were also three negro cabins; one before the house, and two
behind it. The house was a neat building of logs, boarded
over and painted on the outside. On the inside, the logs were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
neatly hewn to a plane face, and exposed. One of the lower
rooms contained a bed, and but little other furniture; the
other was the common family apartment, but also was furnished
with a bed. A door opened into another smaller log house
in the rear, in which were two rooms—one of them the
family dining-room; the other the kitchen. Behind this was
still another log erection, fifteen feet square, which was the
smoke-house, and in which a great store of bacon was kept.
The negro cabins were small, dilapidated, and dingy; the
walls were not chinked, and there were no windows—which,
indeed, would have been a superfluous luxury, for there were
spaces of several inches between the logs, through which there
was unobstructed vision. The furniture in the cabins was of
the simplest and rudest imaginable kind, two or three beds
with dirty clothing upon them, a chest, a wooden stool or two
made with an axe, and some earthenware and cooking apparatus.
Everything within the cabins was coloured black by
smoke. The chimneys of both the house and the cabins were
built of splinters and clay, and on the outer side of the walls.
At the door of each cabin were literally “heaps” of babies and
puppies, and behind or beside it a pig-stye and poultry coop,
a ley-tub, and quantities of home-carded cotton placed upon
boards to bleach. Within each of them was a woman or two,
spinning with the old-fashioned great wheel, and in the kitchen
another woman was weaving coarse cotton shirting with the
ancient rude hand-loom. The mistress herself was spinning
in the living-room, and asked, when we had grown acquainted,
what women at the North could find to do, and how they
could ever pass the time, when they gave up spinning and
weaving. She made the common every-day clothing for all
her family and her servants. They only bought a few “store-goods”
for their “dress-up” clothes. She kept the negro girls
spinning all through the winter, and at all times when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
were not needed in the field. She supposed they would
begin to plant corn now in a few days, and then the girls
would go to work out of doors. I noticed that all the
bed-clothing, the towels, curtains, etc., in the house, were of
homespun.</p>

<p>The proprietor, who had been absent on a fishing excursion,
during the day, returned at dusk. He was a man of
the fat, slow-and-easy style, and proved to be good-natured,
talkative, and communicative. He had bought the tract of
land he now occupied, and moved upon it about ten years
before. He had made a large clearing, and could now sell it
for a good deal more than he gave for it. He intended to
sell whenever he could get a good offer, and move on West.
It was the best land in this part of the country, and he had
got it well fenced, and put up a nice house: there were a
great many people that like to have these things done for
them in advance—and he thought he should not have to wait
long for a purchaser. He liked himself to be clearing land,
and it was getting too close settled about here to suit him.
He did not have much to do but to hunt and fish, and the
game was getting so scarce it was too much trouble to go
after it. He did not think there were so many cat in the
creek as there used to be either, but there were more gar-fish.
When he first bought this land he was not worth much—had
to run in debt—hadn’t but three negroes. Now, he was
pretty much out of debt and owned twenty negroes, seven of
them prime field-hands, and he reckoned I had not seen
a better lot anywhere.</p>

<p>During the evening, all the cabins were illuminated by
great fires, and, looking into one of them, I saw a very picturesque
family group; a man sat on the ground making a
basket, a woman lounged on a chest in the chimney corner
smoking a pipe, and a boy and two girls sat in a bed which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
had been drawn up opposite to her, completing the fireside
circle. They were talking and laughing cheerfully.</p>

<p>The next morning when I turned out I found Yazoo looking
with the eye of a connoisseur at the seven prime field-hands,
who at half-past seven were just starting off with hoes
and axes for their day’s work. As I approached him, he
exclaimed with enthusiasm:—</p>

<p>“Aren’t them a right keen lookin’ lot of niggers?”</p>

<p>And our host soon after coming out, he immediately walked
up to him, saying:—</p>

<p>“Why, friend, them yer niggers o’ yourn would be good
for seventy bales of cotton, if you’d move down into our
country.”</p>

<p>Their owner was perfectly aware of their value, and said
everything good of them.</p>

<p>“There’s something ruther singlar, too, about my niggers;
I don’t know as I ever see anything like it anywhere else.”</p>

<p>“How so, sir?”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon it’s my way o’ treatin’ ’em, much as anything.
I never hev no difficulty with ’em. Hen’t licked a
nigger in five year, ’cept maybe sprouting some of the young
ones sometimes. Fact, my niggers never want no lookin’
arter; they jus tek ker o’ themselves. Fact, they do tek a
greater interest in the crops than I do myself. There’s
another thing—I ’spose ’twill surprise you—there ent one of
my niggers but what can read; read good, too—better ’n I
can, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“How did they learn?”</p>

<p>“Taught themselves. I b’lieve there was one on ’em that
I bought, that could read, and he taught all the rest. But
niggers is mighty apt at larnin’, a heap more ’n white folks
is.”</p>

<p>I said that this was contrary to the generally received opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>“Well, now, let me tell you,” he continued; “I had a boy
to work, when I was buildin’, and my boys jus teachin’ him
night times and such, he warn’t here more’n three months,
and he larned to read as well as any man I ever heerd, and I
know he didn’t know his letters when he come here. It didn’t
seem to me any white man could have done that; does it to
you, now?”</p>

<p>“How old was he?”</p>

<p>“Warn’t more’n seventeen, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“How do they get books—do you get them for them?”</p>

<p>“Oh no; get ’em for themselves.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Buy ’em.”</p>

<p>“How do they get the money?”</p>

<p>“Earn it.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“By their own work. I tell you my niggers have got
more money ’n I hev.”</p>

<p>“What kind of books do they get?”</p>

<p>“Religious kind a books ginerally—these stories; and
some of them will buy novels, I believe. They won’t let on
to that, but I expect they do it.”</p>

<p>They bought them of peddlers. I inquired about the law
to prevent negroes reading, and asked if it allowed books to
be sold to negroes. He had never heard of any such law—didn’t
believe there was any. The Yazoo man said there was
such a law in his country. Negroes never had anything to
read there. I asked our host if his negroes were religious, as
their choice of works would have indicated.</p>

<p>“Yes; all on ’em, I reckon. Don’t s’pose you’ll believe
it, but I tell you it’s a fact; I haint heerd a swear on this
place for a twelvemonth. They keep the Lord’s day, too,
right tight, in gineral.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>“Our niggers is mighty wicked down in Yallerbush county,”
said my companion; “they dance.”</p>

<p>“Dance on Sunday?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, we don’t allow that.”</p>

<p>“What do they do, then—go to meeting?”</p>

<p>“Why, Sundays they sleep mostly; they’ve been at work
hard all the week, you know, and Sundays they stay in their
cabins, and sleep and talk to each other. There’s so
many of ’em together, they don’t want to go visiting off the
place.”</p>

<p>“Are your negroes Baptists or Methodists?” I inquired of
our host.</p>

<p>“All Baptists; niggers allers want to be ducked, you
know. They ain’t content to be just titch’d with water; they
must be ducked in all over. There was two niggers jined
the Methodists up here last summer, and they made the
minister put ’em into the branch; they wouldn’t jine ’less
he’d duck ’em.”</p>

<p>“The Bible says baptize, too,” observed Yazoo.</p>

<p>“Well, they think they must be ducked all under, or
’tain’t no good.”</p>

<p>“Do they go to meeting?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they hev a meeting among themselves.”</p>

<p>“And a preacher?”</p>

<p>“Yes; a nigger preacher.”</p>

<p>“Our niggers is mighty wicked; they dance!” repeated
Yazoo.</p>

<p>“Do you consider dancing so very wicked, then?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t account so myself, as I know on, but they
do, you know—the pious people, all kinds, except the ’Piscopers;
some o’ them, they do dance themselves, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Do you dance in your country?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>“What sort of dances—cotillions and reels?”</p>

<p>“Yes; what do you?”</p>

<p>“Well, we dance cotillions and reels too, and we dance on
a plank; that’s the kind of dancin’ I like best.”</p>

<p>“How is it done?”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know that? You stand face to face with
your partner on a plank and keep a dancin’. Put the plank
up on two barrel heads, so it’ll kind o’ spring. At some of
our parties—that’s among common kind o’ people, you know—it’s
great fun. They dance as fast as they can, and the
folks all stand round and holler, <i>‘Keep it up, John!’ ‘Go
it, Nance!’ ‘Don’t give it up so!’ ‘Old Virginny never
tire!’ ‘Heel and toe, ketch a fire!’</i> and such kind of observations,
and clap and stamp ’em.”</p>

<p>“Do your negroes dance much?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are mighty fond on’t. Saturday night they
dance all night, and Sunday nights too. Daytime they sleep
and rest themselves, and Sunday nights we let ’em dance and
sing if they want. It does ’em good, you know, to enjoy
theirselves.”</p>

<p>“They dance to the banjo, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Banjos and violins; some of ’em has got violins.”</p>

<p>“I like to hear negroes sing,” said I.</p>

<p>“Niggers is allers good singers nat’rally,” said our host.
“I reckon they got better lungs than white folks, they hev
such powerful voices.”</p>

<p>We were sitting at this time on the rail fence at the corner
of a hog-pen and a large half-cleared field. In that part of
this field nearest the house, among the old stumps, twenty or
thirty small fruit trees had been planted. I asked what sorts
they were.</p>

<p>“I don’t know—good kinds tho’, I expect; I bought ’em
for that at any rate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“Where did you buy them?”</p>

<p>“I bought ’em of a feller that came a peddlin’ round here
last fall; he said I’d find ’em good.”</p>

<p>“What did you pay for them?”</p>

<p>“A bit apiece.”</p>

<p>“That’s very cheap, if they’re good for anything; you are
sure they’re grafted, arn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Only by what he said—he said they was grafted kinds.
I’ve got a paper in the housen he gin me, tells about ’em;
leastways, he said it did. They’s the curosest kinds of trees
printed into it you ever heerd on. But I did not buy none,
only the fruit kinds.”</p>

<p>Getting off the fence I began to pick about the roots of
one of them with my pocket-knife. After exposing the trunk
for five or six inches below the surface, I said, “You’ve
planted these too deep, if they’re all like this. You should
have the ground dished about it or it won’t grow.” I tried
another, and after picking some minutes without finding any
signs of the “collar,” I asked if they had all been planted so
deeply.</p>

<p>“I don’t know—I told the boys to put ’em in about two
feet, and I expect they did, for they fancied to have apple-trees
growin’.”</p>

<p>The catalogue of the tree-peddler, which afterwards came
into my possession, quite justified the opinion my host expressed
of the kinds of trees described in it. The reader shall
judge for himself, and I assure him that the following is a
literal transcript of it, omitting the sections headed “Ancebus
new,” “Camelias,” “Rhododendrums,” “Bubbs Pæony,”
“Rosiers,” “Wind’s flowers of the greatest scarcity,” “Bulbous
Roots, and of various kinds of graines.”</p>

<p>The admirable and strange plant called <i>Trompette du Jugement</i> (The Judgment Trompette)
of that name having not yet found its classification.</p>

<p>This marvellous plant was send to us from China by the cleuer and courageous botanist
collector M. Fortune, from l’Himalaya, near summet of the Chamalari Macon.</p>

<p>This splendid plant deserves the first rank among all kinds of plant which the botanical
science has produce till now in spite of all the new discoveries.</p>

<p>This bulbous plant gives several stems on the same subject. It grows to the height of 6
feet. It is furnished with flowers from bottom to top. The bud looks by his from like a
big cannon ball of a heavenly blue. The center is of an aurora yellewish colour. The vegetation
of that plant is to fouitfull that when it is near to blossom it gives a great heat when
tassing it in hand and when the bud opens it produces a naite Similar to a pistole shot. Immediately
the vegetation takes fire and burns like alcohol about an hour and a half. The
flowers succeeding one to the other gives the satisfaction of having flowers during 7 or 8
months.</p>

<p>The most intense cold can not hurt this plant and can be culvivated in pots, in appartments
or gpeen houses.</p>

<p>Wa call the public attention to this plant as a great curiosity.</p>

<p>“But come,” said the farmer, “go in; take a drink.
Breakfast’ll be ready right smart.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to drink before breakfast, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I’m not accustomed to it, and I don’t find it’s wholesome.”</p>

<p>Not wholesome to drink before breakfast! That was “a
new kink” to our jolly host, and troubled him as much as a
new “ism” would an old fogy. Not wholesome? He had
always reckoned it warn’t very wholesome not to drink before
breakfast. He did not expect I had seen a great many
healthier men than he was, had I? and he always took a
drink before breakfast. If a man just kept himself well strung
up, without ever stretching himself right tight, he didn’t
reckon damps or heat would ever do him much harm. He
had never had a sick day since he came to this place, and he
reckoned that this was owin’ considerable to the good rye
whisky he took. It was a healthy trac’ of land, though, he
believed, a mighty healthy trac’; everything seemed to thrive
here. We must see a nigger-gal that he was raisin’; she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
was just coming five, and would pull up nigh upon a hundred
weight.</p>

<p>“Two year ago,” he continued, after taking his dram, as
we sat by the fire in the north room, “when I had a carpenter
here to finish off this house, I told one of my boys he must
come in and help him. I reckoned he would larn quick, if he
was a mind to. So he come in, and a week arterwards he
fitted the plank and laid this floor, and now you just look at it;
I don’t believe any man could do it better. That was two
year ago, and now he’s as good a carpenter as you ever see. I
bought him some tools after the carpenter left, and he can do
anything with ’em—make a table or a chest of drawers or anything.
I think niggers is somehow nat’rally ingenious; more
so ’n white folks. They is wonderful apt to any kind of slight.”</p>

<p>I took out my pocket-map, and while studying it, asked
Yazoo some questions about the route East. Not having yet
studied geography, as he observed, he could not answer. Our
host inquired where I was going, that way. I said I should
go on to Carolina.</p>

<p>“Expect you’re going to buy a rice-farm, in the Carolinies,
aint you? and I reckon you’re up here speckylating arter nigger
stock, aint you now?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “I wouldn’t mind getting that fat girl of
yours, if we can made a trade. How much a pound will you
sell her at?”</p>

<p>“We don’t sell niggers by the pound in this country.”</p>

<p>“Well, how much by the lump?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know; reckon I don’t keer about sellin’ her
just yet.”</p>

<p>After breakfast, I inquired about the management of the
farm. He said that he purchased negroes, as he was able,
from time to time. He grew rich by the improved saleable
value of his land, arising in part from their labour, and from
their natural increase and improvement, for he bought only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
such as would be likely to increase in value on his hands. He
had been obliged to spend but little money, being able to live
and provide most of the food and clothing for his family and
his people, by the production of his farm. He made a little
cotton, which he had to send some distance to be ginned and
baled, and then waggoned it seventy miles to a market; also
raised some wheat, which he turned into flour at a neighbouring
mill, and sent to the same market. This transfer engaged
much of the winter labour of his man-slaves.</p>

<p>I said that I supposed the Memphis and Charleston railroad,
as it progressed east, would shorten the distance to which it
would be necessary to draw his cotton, and so be of much service
to him. He did not know that. He did not know as he
should ever use it. He expected they would charge pretty
high for carrying cotton, and his niggers hadn’t any thing else
to do. It did not really cost him anything now to send it to
Memphis, because he had to board the niggers and the cattle
anyhow, and they did not want much more on the road than
they did at home.</p>

<p>He made a large crop of corn, which, however, was mainly
consumed by his own force, and he killed annually about one
hundred and fifty hogs, the bacon of which was all consumed
in his own family and by his people, or sold to passing travellers.
In the fall, a great many drovers and slave-dealers
passed over the road with their stock, and they frequently
camped against this house, so as to buy corn and bacon of him.
This they cooked themselves.</p>

<p>There were sometimes two hundred negroes brought along
together, going South. He didn’t always have bacon to spare
for them, though he killed one hundred and fifty swine. They
were generally bad characters, and had been sold for fault by
their owners. Some of the slave-dealers were high-minded,
honourable men, he thought; “high-toned gentlemen, as ever
he saw, some of ’em, was.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>Niggers were great eaters, and wanted more meat than
white folks; and he always gave his as much as they wanted,
and more too. The negro cook always got dinner for them,
and took what she liked for it; his wife didn’t know much
about it. She got as much as she liked, and he guessed she
didn’t spare it. When the field-hands were anywhere within
a reasonable distance, they always came up to the house to get
their dinner. If they were going to work a great way off,
they would carry their dinner with them. They did as they
liked about it. When they hadn’t taken their dinner, the cook
called them at twelve o’clock with a conch. They ate in the
kitchen, and he had the same dinner that they did, right out
of the same frying-pan; it was all the same, only they ate in
the kitchen, and he ate in the room we were in, with the door
open between them.</p>

<p>I brought up the subject of the cost of labour, North and
South. He had no apprehension that there would ever be any
want of labourers at the South, and could not understand that
the ruling price indicated the state of the demand for them.
He thought negroes would increase more rapidly than the
need for their labour. “Niggers,” said he, “breed faster than
white folks, a ’mazin’ sight, you know; they begin younger.”</p>

<p>“How young do they begin?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes at fourteen, sometimes at sixteen, and sometimes
at eighteen.”</p>

<p>“Do you let them marry so young as that?” I inquired.
He laughed, and said, “They don’t very often wait to be
married.”</p>

<p>“When they marry, do they have a minister to marry
them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, generally one of their own preachers.”</p>

<p>“Do they with you?” I inquired of Yazoo.</p>

<p>“Yes, sometimes they hev a white minister, and sometimes
a black one, and if there arn’t neither handy, they get some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
the pious ones to marry ’em. But then very often they only
just come and ask our consent, and then go ahead, without any
more ceremony. They just call themselves married. But
most niggers likes a ceremony, you know, and they generally
make out to hev one somehow. They don’t very often get
married for good, though, without trying each other, as they
say, for two or three weeks, to see how they are going to like
each other.”</p>

<p>I afterwards asked how far it was to the post-office. It was
six miles. “One of my boys,” said our host, “always gets
the paper every week. He goes to visit his wife, and passes
by the post-office every Sunday. Our paper hain’t come,
though, now, for three weeks. The mail don’t come very regular.”
All of his negroes, who had wives off the place, left
an hour before sunset on Saturday evening. One of them,
who had a wife twenty miles away, left at twelve o’clock Saturday,
and got back at twelve o’clock Monday.</p>

<p>“We had a nigger once,” said Yazoo, “that had a wife fifteen
miles away, and he used to do so; but he did some rascality
once, and he was afraid to go again. He told us his
wife was so far off, ’twas too much trouble to go there, and he
believed he’d give her up. We was glad of it. He was a
darned rascally nigger—allers getting into scrapes. One time
we sent him to mill, and he went round into town and sold
some of the meal. The storekeeper wouldn’t pay him for’t,
’cause he hadn’t got an order. The next time we were in town,
the storekeeper just showed us the bag of meal; said he reckoned
’twas stole; so when we got home we just tied him up
to the tree and licked him. He’s a right smart nigger; rascally
niggers allers is smart. I’d rather have a rascally nigger
than any other—they’s so smart allers. He is about the best
nigger we’ve got.”</p>

<p>“I have heard,” said I, “that religious negroes were generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
the most valuable. I have been told that a third more
would be given for a man if he were religious.” “Well, I
never heerd of it before,” said he. Our host thought there
was no difference in the market value of sinners and saints.</p>

<p>“Only,” observed Yazoo, “the rascalier a nigger is, the
better he’ll work. Now that yer nigger I was tellin’ you on,
he’s worth more’n any other nigger we’ve got. He’s a yaller
nigger.”</p>

<p>I asked their opinion as to the comparative value of black
and yellow negroes. Our host had two bright mulatto boys
among his—didn’t think there was much difference, “but
allers reckoned yellow fellows was the best a little; they
worked smarter. He would rather have them.” Yazoo
would not; he “didn’t think but what they’d work as well;
but he didn’t fancy yellow negroes ’round him; would rather
have real black ones.”</p>

<p>I asked our host if he had no foreman or driver for his negroes,
or if he gave his directions to one of them in particular
for all the rest. He did not. They all did just as they
pleased, and arranged the work among themselves. They
never needed driving.</p>

<p>“If I ever notice one of ’em getting a little slack, I just
talk to him; tell him we must get out of the grass, and I
want to hev him stir himself a little more, and then, maybe,
I slip a dollar into his hand, and when he gits into the field
he’ll go ahead, and the rest seeing him, won’t let themselves
be distanced by him. My niggers never want no lookin’
arter. They tek more interest in the crop than I do myself,
every one of ’em.”</p>

<p>Religious, instructed, and seeking further enlightenment;
industrious, energetic, and self directing; well fed, respected,
and trusted by their master, and this master an illiterate, indolent,
and careless man! A very different state of things,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
this, from what I saw on a certain great cotton planter’s
estate, where a profit of $100,000 was made in a single year,
but where five hundred negroes were constantly kept under
the whip, where religion was only a pow-wow or cloak for
immorality, and where the negro was considered to be of an
inferior race, especially designed by Providence to be kept in
the position he there occupied! A very different thing; and
strongly suggesting what a very different thing this negro
servitude might be made in general, were the ruling disposition
of the South more just and sensible.</p>

<p>About half-past eleven, a stage coach, which had come earlier
in the morning from the East, and had gone on as far as the
brook, returned, having had our luggage transferred to it from
the one we had left on the other side. In the transfer a portion
of mine was omitted and never recovered. Up to this time our
host had not paid the smallest attention to any work his men
were doing, or even looked to see if they had fed the cattle, but
had lounged about, sitting upon a fence, chewing tobacco, and
talking with us, evidently very glad to have somebody to converse
with. He went in once again, after a drink; showed us
the bacon he had in his smoke-house, and told a good many
stories of his experience in life, about a white man’s “dying
hard” in the neighbourhood, and of a tree falling on a team
with which one of his negroes was ploughing cotton, “which
was lucky”—that is, that it did not kill the negro—and a
good deal about “hunting” when he was younger and
lighter.</p>

<p>Still absurdly influenced by an old idea which I had
brought to the South with me, I waited, after the coach came
in sight, for Yazoo to put the question, which he presently
did, boldly enough.</p>

<p>“Well; reckon we’re goin’ now. What’s the damage?”</p>

<p>“Well; reckon seventy-five cents’ll be right.”</p>

<span class="s08">THE INTERIOR COTTON DISTRICTS—CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI,
ALABAMA, ETC.</span></h2>

<p><i>Central Mississippi, May 31st.</i>—Yesterday was a raw, cold
day, wind north-east, like a dry north-east storm at home.
Fortunately I came to the pleasantest house and household I
had seen for some time. The proprietor was a native of
Maryland, and had travelled in the North; a devout Methodist,
and somewhat educated. He first came South, as I understood,
for the benefit of his health, his lungs being weak.</p>

<p>His first dwelling, a rude log cabin, was still standing, and
was occupied by some of his slaves. The new house, a cottage,
consisting of four rooms and a hall, stood in a small grove of
oaks; the family were quiet, kind, and sensible.</p>

<p>When I arrived, the oldest boy was at work, holding a
plough in the cotton-field, but he left it and came at once, with
confident and affable courtesy, to entertain me.</p>

<p>My host had been in Texas, and after exploring it quite
thoroughly, concluded that he much preferred to remain where
he was. He found no part of that country where good land,
timber, and a healthy climate were combined: in the West he
did not like the vicinage of the Germans and Mexicans; moreover,
he didn’t “fancy” a prairie county. Here, in favourable
years, he got a bale of cotton to the acre. Not so much now
as formerly. Still, he said, the soil would be good enough
for him here, for many years to come.</p>

<p>I went five times to the stable without being able to find
a servant there. I was always told that “the boy” would
feed my horse, and take good care of him, when he came;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
and so at length I had to go to bed, trusting to this assurance.
I went out just before breakfast next morning, and found the
horse with only ten <i>dry</i> cobs in the manger. I searched for
the boy; could not find him, but was told that my horse had
been fed. I said, “I wish to have him fed more—as much
as he will eat.” Very well, the boy should give him more.
When I went out after breakfast the boy was leading out the
horse. I asked if he had given him corn this morning.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“How many ears did you give him?”</p>

<p>“Ten or fifteen—or sixteen, sir; he eats very hearty.”</p>

<p>I went into the stable and saw that he had not been fed;
there were the same ten cobs (dry) in the manger. I doubted,
indeed, from their appearance, if the boy had fed him at all
the night before. I fed him with leaves myself, but could not
get into the corn crib. The proprietor was, I do not doubt,
perfectly honest, but the negro had probably stolen the corn
for his own hogs and fowls.</p>

<p>The next day I rode more than thirty miles, having secured
a good feed of corn for the horse at midday. At nightfall I
was much fatigued, but had as yet failed to get lodging. It
began to rain, and grew dark, and I kept the road with difficulty.
About nine o’clock I came to a large, comfortable
house.</p>

<p>An old lady sat in the verandah, of whom I asked if I could
be accommodated for the night: “Reckon so,” she replied:
then after a few moments’ reflection, without rising from her
chair she shouted, “Gal!—gal!” Presently a girl came.</p>

<p>“Missis?”</p>

<p>“Call Tom!”</p>

<p>The girl went off, while I remained, waiting for a more
definite answer. At length she returned: “Tom ain’t there,
missis.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“Who is there?”</p>

<p>“Old Pete,”</p>

<p>“Well, tell him to come and take this gentleman’s horse.”</p>

<p>Pete came, and I went with him to the gate where I had
fastened my horse. Here he called for some younger slave to
come and take him down to “the pen,” while he took off the
saddle.</p>

<p>All this time it was raining, but any rapidity of movement
was out of the question. Pete continued shouting. “Why
not lead the horse to the pen yourself?” I asked. “I must
take care of de saddle and tings, massa; tote ’em to de house
whar dey’ll be safe. Dese niggers is so treacherous, can’t
leave nothin’ roun’ but dey’ll hook suthing off of it.”</p>

<p>Next morning, at dawn of day, I saw honest Pete come
into the room where I was in bed and go stealthily to his
young master’s clothes, probably mistaking them for mine.
I moved and he dropped them, and slunk out to the next room,
where he went loudly to making a fire. I managed to see the
horse well fed night and morning.</p>

<p>There were three pretty young women in this house, of
good manners and well dressed, except for the abundance of
rings and jewelry which they displayed at breakfast. One of
them surprised me not a little at the table. I had been
offered, in succession, fried ham and eggs, sweet potatoes,
apple-pie, corn-bread, and molasses; this last article I declined,
and passed it to the young lady opposite, looking to
see how it was to be used. She had, on a breakfast plate,
fried ham and eggs and apple-pie, and poured molasses
between them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>June 1st.</i>—I stopped last evening at the house of a man
who was called “Doctor” by his family, but who was, to judge
from his language, very illiterate. His son, by whom I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
first received, followed me to the stable. He had ordered a
negro child to lead my horse, but as I saw the little fellow
couldn’t hold him I went myself. He had no fodder (corn-leaves),
and proposed to give the horse some shucks (corn-husks)
dipped in salt water, and, as it was now too late to go
further, I assented. Belshazzar licked them greedily, but
would not eat them, and they seemed to destroy his appetite
for corn, for late in the evening, having groped my way into
the stable, I found seven small ears of corn, almost untasted,
in the manger. I got the young man to come out and give
him more.</p>

<p>The “Doctor” returned from “a hunt,” as he said, with no
game but a turtle, which he had taken from a “trot line”—a
line, with hooks at intervals, stretched across the river.</p>

<p>The house was large, and in a good-sized parlour or common
room stood a handsome centre table, on which were a
few books and papers, mostly Baptist publications. I sat
here alone in the evening, straining my eyes to read a
wretchedly printed newspaper, till I was offered a bed. I
was very tired and sleepy, having been ill two nights before.
The bed was apparently clean, and I gladly embraced it.</p>

<p>My host, holding a candle for me to undress by (there
was no candlestick in the house), called to a boy on the
outside to fasten the doors, which he did by setting articles
of furniture against them. When I had got into bed he went
himself into an inner room, the door of which he closed and
fastened in the same manner. No sooner was the light withdrawn
than I was attacked by bugs. I was determined, if
possible, not to be kept awake by them, but they soon conquered
me. I never suffered such incessant and merciless
persecution from them before. In half an hour I was nearly
frantic, and leaped from bed. But what to do? There was
no use in making a disturbance about it; doubtless every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
other bed and resting place in the house was full of them. I
shook out my day clothes carefully and put them on, and
then pushing away the barricade, opened the door and went
into the parlour. At first I thought that I would arrange
the chairs in a row and sleep on them; but this I found
impracticable, for the seats of the chairs were too narrow, and
moreover of deerskin, which was sure to be full of fleas if not
of bugs. Stiff and sore and weak, I groaningly lay down
where the light of the moon came through a broken window,
for bugs feed but little except in darkness, and with my
saddle-bags for a pillow, again essayed to sleep. Fleas! instantly.
There was nothing else to be done; I was too tired
to sit up, even if that would have effectually removed the
annoyance. Finally I dozed—not long, I think, for I was
suddenly awakened by a large insect dropping upon my eye.
I struck it off, and at the moment it stung me. My eyelid
swelled immediately, and grew painful, but at length I slept
in spite of it. I was once more awakened by a large beetle
which fell on me from the window; once more I got asleep,
till finally at four o’clock I awoke with that feverish dryness
of the eyes which indicates a determination to sleep no more.
It was daylight, and I was stiff and shivering; the inflammation
and pain of the sting in my eyelid had in a great degree
subsided. I pushed back the bolt of the outside door-lock,
and went to the stable. The negroes were already at work
in the field. Belshazzar had had a bad night too: that was
evident. The floor of the stall, being of earth, had been
trodden into two hollows at each end, leaving a small rough
hillock in the centre. Bad as it was, however, it was the
best in the stable; only one in four of the stalls having a
manger that was not broken down. A wee little black girl
and boy were cleaning their master’s horses—mine they were
afraid of. They had managed to put some fresh corn in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
manger, however, and as he refused to eat, I took a currycomb
and brush, and in the next two hours gave him the first
thorough grooming he had enjoyed since I owned him. I
could not detect the reason of his loss of appetite. I had
been advised by an old southern traveller to examine the corn
when my horse refused to eat—if corn were high I might find
that it had been greased. From the actions of the horse,
then and subsequently, I suspect some trick of this kind was
here practised upon me. When I returned to the house and
asked to wash, water was given me in a vessel which, though
I doubted the right of my host to a medical diploma, certainly
smelt strongly of the shop—it was such as is used by apothecaries
in mixing drugs. The title of Doctor is often popularly
given at the South to druggists and venders of popular medicines;
very probably he had been one, and had now retired
to enjoy the respectability of a planter.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>June 2nd.</i>—I met a ragged old negro, of whom I asked the
way, and at what house within twelve miles I had better stop.
He advised me to go to one more than twelve miles distant.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said I, “I can stop at any house along the
road here, can’t I? They’ll all take in travellers?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, if you’ll take rough fare, such as travellers has
to, sometimes. They’re all damn’d rascals along dis road, for
ten or twelve miles, and you’ll get nothin’ but rough fare.
But I say, massa, rough fare’s good enough for dis world;
ain’t it, massa? Dis world ain’t nothin; dis is hell, dis is,
I calls it; hell to what’s a comin’ arter, ha! ha! Ef you’s
prepared? you says. I don’t look much ’s if I was prepared,
does I? nor talk like it, nuther. De Lord he cum to me in
my cabin in de night time, in de year ’45.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“De Lord! massa, de bressed Lord! He cum to me in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
de night time, in de year ’45, and he says to me, says he,
‘I’ll spare you yet five year longer, old boy!’ So when ’50
cum round I thought my time had cum, sure; but as I didn’t
die, I reckon de Lord has ’cepted of me, and I ’specs I shall
be saved, dough I don’t look much like it, ha! ha! ho! ho!
de Lord am my rock, and he shall not perwail over me. I
will lie down in green pastures and take up my bed in hell,
yet will not His mercy circumwent me. Got some baccy,
master?”</p>

<p>A little after sunset I came to an unusually promising
plantation, the dwelling being within a large enclosure, in
which there was a well-kept southern sward shaded by fine
trees. The house, of the usual form, was painted white, and
the large number of neat out-buildings seemed to indicate
opulence, and, I thought, unusual good taste in its owner.
A lad of sixteen received me, and said I could stay; I might
fasten my horse, and when the negroes came up he would
have him taken care of. When I had done so, and had
brought the saddle to the verandah, he offered me a chair,
and at once commenced a conversation in the character of
entertainer. Nothing in his tone or manner would have
indicated that he was not the father of the family, and proprietor
of the establishment. No prince royal could have
had more assured and nonchalant dignity. Yet a northern
stable-boy, or apprentice, of his age, would seldom be found
as ignorant.</p>

<p>“Where do you live, sir, when you are at home?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“At New York.”</p>

<p>“New York is a big place, sir, I expect?”</p>

<p>“Yes, very big.”</p>

<p>“Big as New Orleans, is it, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, much bigger.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>“Bigger ’n New Orleans? It must be a bully city.”</p>

<p>“Yes; the largest in America.”</p>

<p>“Sickly there now, sir?”</p>

<p>“No, not now; it is sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Like New Orleans, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No, never so bad as New Orleans sometimes is.”</p>

<p>“Right healthy place, I expect, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe so, for a place of its size.”</p>

<p>“What diseases do you have there, sir?”</p>

<p>“All sorts of diseases—not so much fever, however, as you
have hereabouts.”</p>

<p>“Measles and hooping-cough, sometimes, I reckon?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ’most all the time, I dare say.”</p>

<p>“All the time! People must die there right smart. Some
is dyin’ ’most every day, I expect, sir?”</p>

<p>“More than a hundred every day, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Gosh! a hundred every day! Almighty sickly place ’t
must be?”</p>

<p>“It is such a large place, you see—seven hundred thousand
people.”</p>

<p>“Seven hundred thousand—expect that’s a heap of people,
ain’t it?”</p>

<p>His father, a portly, well-dressed man, soon came in, and
learning that I had been in Mexico, said, “I suppose there’s
a heap of Americans flocking in and settling up that country
along on the line, ain’t there, sir?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, very few. I saw none, in fact—only a few
Irishmen and Frenchmen, who called themselves Americans.
Those were the only foreigners I saw, except negroes.”</p>

<p>“Niggers! Where were they from?”</p>

<p>“They were runaways from Texas.”</p>

<p>“But their masters go there and get them again, don’t
they?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>“No, sir, they can’t.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“The Mexicans are friendly to the niggers, and protect
them.”</p>

<p>“But why not go to the Government?”</p>

<p>“The Government considers them as free, and will not let
them be taken back.”</p>

<p>“But that’s stealing, sir. Why don’t our Government make
them deliver them up? What good is the Government to us
if it don’t preserve the rights of property, sir? Niggers are
property, ain’t they? and if a man steals my property, ain’t
the Government bound to get it for me? Niggers are property,
sir, the same as horses and cattle, and nobody’s any
more right to help a nigger that’s run away than he has to
steal a horse.”</p>

<p>He spoke very angrily, and was excited. Perhaps he was
indirectly addressing me, as a Northern man, on the general
subject of fugitive slaves. I said that it was necessary to
have special treaty stipulations about such matters. The
Mexicans lost their <i>peons</i>—bounden servants; they ran away
to our side, but the United States Government never took any
measures to restore them, nor did the Mexicans ask it.
“But,” he answered, in a tone of indignation, “those are not
niggers, are they? They are white people, sir, just as
white as the Mexicans themselves, and just as much right to
be free.”</p>

<p>My horse stood in the yard till quite dark, the negroes not
coming in from the cotton-field. I twice proposed to take
him to the stable, but he said, “No: the niggers would come
up soon and attend to him.” Just as we were called to supper,
the negroes began to make their appearance, getting over a
fence with their hoes, and the master called to one to put the
horse in the stable, and to “take good care of him.” “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
want him to have all the corn he’ll eat,” said I. “Yes, sir;
feed him well; do you hear there?”</p>

<p>The house was meagrely furnished within, not nearly as
well as the most common New England farm-house. I saw
no books and no decorations. The interior wood-work was
unpainted.</p>

<p>At supper there were three negro girls in attendance—two
children of twelve or fourteen years of age, and an older one,
but in a few moments they all disappeared. The mistress
called aloud several times, and at length the oldest came,
bringing in hot biscuit.</p>

<p>“Where’s Suke and Bet?”</p>

<p>“In the kitchen, missus.”</p>

<p>“Tell them both to come to me, right off.”</p>

<p>A few minutes afterwards, one of the girls slunk in and
stood behind me, as far as possible from her mistress. Presently,
however, she was discovered.</p>

<p>“You Bet, you there? Come here! come here to me!
close to me! (<i>Slap, slap, slap.</i>) Now, why don’t you stay
in here? (<i>Slap, slap, slap</i>, on the side of the head.) I
know! you want to be out in the kitchen with them Indians!
(<i>Slap, slap, slap.</i>) Now see if you can stay here.” (<i>Slap!</i>)
The other girl didn’t come at all, and was forgotten.</p>

<p>As soon as supper was over my hostess exclaimed, “Now,
you Bet, stop crying there, and do you go right straight
home; mind you run every step of the way, and if you stop
one minute in the kitchen you’d better look out. Begone!”
During the time I was in the house she was incessantly scolding
the servants, in a manner very disagreeable for me to
hear, though they seemed to regard it very little.</p>

<p>The Indians, I learned, lived some miles away, and were
hired to hoe cotton. I inquired their wages. “Well, it
costs me about four bits (fifty cents) a day,” (including food,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
probably). They worked well for a few days at a time;
were better at picking than at hoeing. “They don’t pick so
much in a day as niggers, but do it better.” The women
said they were good for nothing, and her husband had no
business to plant so much cotton that he couldn’t ’tend it
with his own slave hands.</p>

<p>While at table a young man, very dirty and sweaty, with
a ragged shirt and no coat on, came in to supper. He was
surly and rude in his actions, and did not speak a word; he
left the table before I had finished, and lighting a pipe, laid
himself at full length on the floor of the room to smoke.
This was the overseer.</p>

<p>Immediately after supper the master told me that he was
in the habit of going to bed early, and he would show me
where I was to sleep. He did so, and left me without a
candle. It was dark, and I did not know the way to the
stables, so I soon went to bed. On a feather bed I did not
enjoy much rest, and when I at last awoke and dressed,
breakfast was just ready. I said I would go first to look
after my horse, and did so, the planter following me. I
found him standing in a miserable stall, in a sorry state; he
had not been cleaned, and there were no cobs or other indications
of his having been fed at all since he had been there. I
said to my host—</p>

<p>“He has not been fed, sir!”</p>

<p>“I wonder! hain’t he? Well, I’ll have him fed. I
s’pose the overseer forgot him.”</p>

<p>But, instead of going to the crib and feeding him at once
himself, he returned to the house and blew a horn for a negro;
when after a long time one came in sight from the cotton-fields,
he called to him to go to the overseer for the key of
the corn-crib and feed the gentleman’s horse, and asked me
now to come to breakfast. The overseer joined us as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
supper; nothing was said to him about my horse, and he was
perfectly silent, and conducted himself like an angry or sulky
man in all his actions. As before, when he had finished his
meal, without waiting for others to leave the table, he lighted
a pipe and lay down to rest on the floor. I went to the
stable and found my horse had been supplied with seven poor
ears of corn only. I came back to ask for more, but could
find neither master nor overseer. While I was packing my
saddle-bags preparatory to leaving, I heard my host call a
negro to “clean that gentleman’s horse and bring him here.”
As it was late, I did not interpose. While I was putting on
the bridle, he took off the musquito tent attached to the
saddle and examined it. I explained why I carried it.</p>

<p>“You won’t want it any more,” said he; “no musquitoes
of any account where you are going now; you’d better give
it to me, sir; I should like to use it when I go a-fishing;
musquitoes are powerful bad in the swamp.” After some
further solicitation, as I seldom used it, I gave it to him.
Almost immediately afterwards he charged me a dollar for my
entertainment, which I paid, notwithstanding the value of
the tent was several times that amount. Hospitality to
travellers is so entirely a matter of business with the common
planters.</p>

<p>I passed the hoe-gang at work in the cotton-field, the
overseer lounging among them carrying a whip; there were
ten or twelve of them; not one looked up at me. Within
ten minutes I passed five who were ploughing, with no overseer
or driver in sight, and each stopped his plough to gaze
at me.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>June 3rd.</i>—Yesterday I met a well-dressed man upon the
road, and inquired of him if he could recommend me to a
comfortable place to pass the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I can,” said he; “you stop at John Watson’s. He
is a real good fellow, and his wife is a nice, tidy woman; he’s
got a good house, and you’ll be as well taken care of there as
in any place I know.”</p>

<p>“What I am most concerned about is a clean bed,” said I.</p>

<p>“Well, you are safe for that, there.”</p>

<p>So distinct a recommendation was unusual, and when I
reached the house he had described to me, though it was not
yet dark, I stopped to solicit entertainment.</p>

<p>In the gallery sat a fine, stalwart man, and a woman, who
in size and figure matched him well. Some ruddy, fat children
were playing on the steps. The man wore a full beard,
which is very uncommon in these parts. I rode to a horse-block
near the gallery, and asked if I could be accommodated
for the night. “Oh, yes, you can stay here if you can get
along without anything to eat; we don’t have anything to
eat but once a week.” “You look as if it agreed with you,
I reckon I’ll try it for one night.” “Alight, sir, alight.
Why, you came from Texas, didn’t you? Your rig looks
like it,” he said, as I dismounted. “Yes, I’ve just crossed
Texas, all the way from the Rio Grande.” “Have you
though? Well, I’ll be right glad to hear something of that
country.” He threw my saddle and bags across the rail of
the gallery, and we walked together to the stable.</p>

<p>“I hear that there are a great many Germans in the
western part of Texas,” he said presently.</p>

<p>“There are a great many; west of the Guadaloupe, more
Germans than Americans born.”</p>

<p>“Have they got many slaves?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, won’t they break off and make a free State down
there, by and by?”</p>

<p>“I should think it not impossible that they might.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“I wish to God they would; I would like right well to go
and settle there if it was free from slavery. You see Kansas
and all the Free States are too far north for me; I was raised
in Alabama, and I don’t want to move into a colder climate;
but I would like to go into a country where they had not got
this curse of slavery.”</p>

<p>He said this not knowing that I was a Northern man.
Greatly surprised, I asked, “What are your objections to
slavery, sir?”</p>

<p>“Objections! The first’s here” (striking his breast); “I
never could bring myself to like it. Well, sir, I know slavery
is wrong, and God ’ll put an end to it. It’s bound to come
to an end, and when the end does come, there’ll be woe in
the land. And, instead of preparing for it, and trying to
make it as light as possible, we are doing nothing but make
it worse and worse. That’s the way it appears to me, and
I’d rather get out of these parts before it comes. Then I’ve
another objection to it. I don’t like to have slaves about me.
Now, I tell a nigger to go and feed your horse; I never know
if he’s done it unless I go and see; and if he didn’t know I
would go and see, and would whip him if I found he hadn’t
fed him, would he feed him? He’d let him starve. I’ve got
as good niggers as anybody, but I never can depend on them;
they will lie, and they will steal, and take advantage of me in
every way they dare. Of course they will, if they are slaves.
But lying and stealing are not the worst of it. I’ve got a
family of children, and I don’t like to have such degraded
beings round my house while they are growing up. I know
what the consequences are to children, of growing up among
slaves.”</p>

<p>I here told him that I was a Northern man, and asked if
he could safely utter such sentiments among the people of this
district, who bore the reputation of being among the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
extreme and fanatical devotees of slavery. “I’ve been told a
hundred times I should be killed if I were not more prudent
in expressing my opinions, but, when it comes to killing, I’m
as good as the next man, and they know it. I never came
the worst out of a fight yet since I was a boy. I never am
afraid to speak what I think to anybody. I don’t think I
ever shall be.”</p>

<p>“Are there many persons here who have as bad an opinion
of slavery as you have?”</p>

<p>“I reckon you never saw a conscientious man who had
been brought up among slaves who did not think of it pretty
much as I do—did you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I have, a good many.”</p>

<p>“Ah, self-interest warps men’s minds wonderfully, but I
don’t believe there are many who don’t think so, sometimes—it’s
impossible, I know, that they don’t.”</p>

<p>“Were there any others in this neighbourhood,” I asked, “who
avowedly hated slavery?” He replied that there were a good
many mechanics, all the mechanics he knew, who felt slavery
to be a great curse to them, and who wanted to see it brought
to an end in some way. The competition in which they were
constantly made to feel themselves engaged with slave-labour
was degrading to them, and they felt it to be so. He knew
a poor, hard-working man who was lately offered the services
of three negroes for six years each if he would let them learn
his trade, but he refused the proposal with indignation, saying
he would starve before he helped a slave to become a mechanic.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
There was a good deal of talk now among them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
about getting laws passed to prevent the owners of slaves
from having them taught trades, and to prohibit slave-mechanics
from being hired out. He could go out to-morrow,
he supposed, and in the course of a day get two hundred signatures
to a paper alleging that slavery was a curse to the
people of Mississippi, and praying the Legislature to take
measures to relieve them of it as soon as practicable. (The
county contains three times as many slaves as whites.)</p>

<p>He considered a coercive government of the negroes by the
whites, forcing them to labour systematically, and restraining
them from a reckless destruction of life and property, at present
to be necessary. Of course, he did not think it wrong to
hold slaves, and the profits of their labour were not more
than enough to pay a man for looking after them—not if he
did his duty to them. What was wrong, was making slavery
so much worse than was necessary. Negroes would improve
very rapidly, if they were allowed, in any considerable
measure, the ordinary incitements to improvement. He
knew hosts of negroes who showed extraordinary talents,
considering their opportunities: there were a great many in
this part of the country who could read and write, and calculate
mentally as well as the general run of white men who
had been to schools. There were Colonel ——’s negroes,
some fifty of them; he did not suppose there were any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
fifty more contented people in the world; they were not
driven hard, and work was stopped three times a day for
meals; they had plenty to eat, and good clothes; and through
the whole year they had from Friday night to Monday morning
to do what they liked with themselves. Saturdays, the
men generally worked in their patches (private gardens), and
the women washed and mended clothes. Sundays, they
nearly all went to a Sabbath School which the mistress taught,
and to meeting, but they were not obliged to go; they could
come and go as they pleased all Saturday and Sunday; they
were not looked after at all. Only on Monday morning, if
there should any one be missing, or any one should come to
the field with ragged or dirty clothes, he would be whipped.
He had often noticed how much more intelligent and sprightly
these negroes all were than the common run; a great many
of them had books and could read and write; and on Sundays
they were smartly dressed, some of them better than he or
his wife ever thought of dressing. These things were purchased
with the money they made out of their patches, working
Saturdays.</p>

<p>There were two other large plantations near him, in both
of which the negroes were turned out to work at half-past
three every week-day morning—I might hear the bell ring
for them—and frequently they were not stopped till nine
o’clock at night, Saturday nights the same as any other.
One of them belonged to a very religious lady, and on Sunday
mornings at half-past nine she had her bell rung for Sunday
School, and after Sunday School they had a meeting, and
after dinner another religious service. Every negro on the
plantation was obliged to attend all these exercises, and if
they were not dressed clean they were whipped. They were
never allowed to go off the plantation, and if they were caught
speaking to a negro from any other place, they were whipped.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
They could all of them repeat the catechism, he believed, but
they were the dullest, and laziest, and most sorrowful looking
negroes he ever saw.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the condition of the slaves, as regards
their material comfort, had greatly improved within twenty
years. He did not know that it had in other respects. It
would not be a bit safer to turn them free to shift for themselves,
than it would have been twenty years ago. Of this he
was quite confident. Perhaps they were a little more intelligent,
knew more, but they were not as capable of self-guidance,
not as much accustomed to work and contrive for
themselves, as they used to be, when they were not fed and
clothed nearly as well as now.</p>

<p>Beyond the excessive labour required of them on some
plantations, he did not think slaves were often treated with
unnecessary cruelty. It was necessary to use the lash occasionally.
Slaves never really felt under any moral obligation to
obey their masters. Faithful service was preached to them
as a Christian duty, and they pretended to acknowledge it,
but the fact was that they were obedient just so far as they
saw that they must be to avoid punishment; and punishment
was necessary, now and then, to maintain their faith in their
master’s power. He had seventeen slaves, and he did not
suppose that there had been a hundred strokes of the whip on
his place for a year past.</p>

<p>He asked if there were many Americans in Texas who
were opposed to slavery, and if they were free to express
themselves. I said that the wealthy Americans there were
all slaveholders themselves; that their influence all went to
encourage the use of slave-labour, and render labour by whites
disreputable. “But are there not a good many northern
men there?” he asked. The northern men, I replied, were
chiefly merchants or speculators, who had but one idea, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
was to make money as fast as they could; and nearly all the
little money there was in that country was in the hands of
the largest slaveholders.</p>

<p>If that was the way of things there, he said, there could
not be much chance of its becoming a Free State. I thought
the chances were against it, but if the Germans continued to
flock into the country, it would rapidly acquire all the
characteristic features of a free-labour community, including
an abundance and variety of skilled labour, a home market
for a variety of crops, denser settlements, and more numerous
social, educational, and commercial conveniences. There
would soon be a large body of small proprietors, not so
wealthy that the stimulus to personal and active industry
would have been lost, but yet able to indulge in a good many
luxuries, to found churches, schools, and railroads, and to
attract thither tradesmen, mechanics, professional men, and
artists. Moreover, the labourers who were not landholders
would be intimately blended with them in all their interests;
the two classes not living dissociated from each other, as was
the case generally at the South, but engaged in a constant
fulfilment of reciprocal obligations. I told him that if such a
character of society could once be firmly and extensively
established before the country was partitioned out into these
little independent negro kingdoms, which had existed from
the beginning in every other part of the South, I did not
think any laws would be necessary to prevent slavery. It
might be a slave State, but it would be a free people.</p>

<p>On coming from my room in the morning, my host met
me with a hearty grasp of the hand. “I have slept very
little with thinking of what you told me about western Texas.
I think I shall have to go there. If we could get rid of
slavery in this region, I believe we would soon be the most
prosperous people in the world. What a disadvantage it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
must be to have your ground all frozen up, and to be obliged
to fodder your cattle five months in the year, as you do at the
North. I don’t see how you live. I think I should like to
buy a small farm near some town where I could send my
children to school—a farm that I could take care of with one
or two hired men. One thing I wanted to ask you, are the
Germans learning English at all?” “Oh, yes; they teach
the children English in their schools.” “And have they good
schools?” “Wherever they have settled at all closely they
have. At New Braunfels they employ American as well as
German teachers, and instruction can be had in the classics,
natural history, and the higher mathematics.” “Upon my
word, I think I must go there,” he replied. (Since then, as
I hear, an educational institution of a high character, has
been established by German influence in San Antonio, teachers
in which are from Harvard.)</p>

<p>When I left he mounted a horse and rode on with me some
miles, saying he did not often find an intelligent man who
liked to converse with him on the question of slavery. It
seemed to him there was an epidemic insanity on the subject.
It is unnecessary to state his views at length. They were
precisely those which used to be common among all respectable
men at the South.</p>

<p>As we rode an old negro met and greeted us warmly. My
companion hereupon observed that he had never uttered his
sentiments in the presence of a slave, but in some way all the
slaves in the country had, he thought, been informed what
they were, for they all looked to him as their special friend.
When they got into trouble, they would often come to him
for advice or assistance. This morning before I was up, a
negro came to him from some miles distant, who had been
working for a white man on Sundays till he owed him three
dollars, which, now that the negro wanted it, he said he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
could not pay. He had given the negro the three dollars,
for he thought he could manage to get it from the white
man.</p>

<p>He confirmed an impression I had begun to get of the
purely dramatic character of what passed for religion with
most of the slaves. One of his slaves was a preacher, and a
favourite among them. He sometimes went to plantations
twenty miles away—even further—on a Sunday, to preach a
funeral sermon, making journeys of fifty miles a day on foot.
After the sermon, a hat would be passed round, and he sometimes
brought home as much as ten dollars. He was a
notable pedestrian; and once when he had committed some
abominable crime for which he knew he would have to be
punished, and had run away, he (Mr. Watson) rode after him
almost immediately, often got in sight of him, but did not
overtake him until the second day, when starting early in the
morning he overhauled him crossing a broad, smooth field.
When the runaway parson saw that he could not escape, he
jumped up into a tree and called out to him, with a cheerful
voice, “I gin ye a good run dis time, didn’t I, massa?” He
was the most rascally negro, the worst liar, thief, and
adulterer on his place. Indeed, when he was preaching, he
always made a strong point of his own sinfulness, and would
weep and bellow about it like a bull of Bashan, till he got a
whole camp meeting into convulsions.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The night after leaving Mr. Watson’s I was kindly received
by a tradesman, who took me, after closing his shop, to his
mother’s house, a log cabin, but more comfortable than many
more pretentious residences at which I passed a night on this
journey. For the first time in many months tea was offered
me. It was coarse Bohea, sweetened with honey, which was
stirred into the tea as it boiled in a kettle over the fire, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
the old lady herself, whose especial luxury it seemed to be.
She asked me if folks ever drank tea at the North, and when
I spoke of green tea said she had never heard of that kind of
tea before. They owned a number of slaves, but the young
man looked after my horse himself. There was a good
assortment of books and newspapers at this house, and the
people were quite intelligent and very amiable.</p>

<p>The next day, I passed a number of small Indian farms,
very badly cultivated—the corn nearly concealed by weeds.
The soil became poorer than before, and the cabins of poor
people more frequent. I counted about ten plantations, or
negro-cultivated farms, in twenty miles. A planter, at whose
house I called after sunset, said it was not convenient for him
to accommodate me, and I was obliged to ride until it was
quite dark. The next house at which I arrived was one of
the commonest sort of cabins. I had passed twenty like it
during the day, and I thought I would take the opportunity
to get an interior knowledge of them. The fact that a horse
and waggon were kept, and that a considerable area of land
in the rear of the cabin was planted with cotton, showed that
the family were by no means of the lowest class, yet, as they
were not able even to hire a slave, they may be considered to
represent very favourably, I believe, the condition of the
poor whites of the plantation districts. The whites of the
county, I observe, by the census, are three to one of the
slaves; in the nearest adjoining county, the proportion is
reversed; and within a few miles the soil was richer, and
large plantations occurred.</p>

<p>It was raining, and nearly nine o’clock. The door of the
cabin was open, and I rode up and conversed with the occupant
as he stood within. He said that he was not in the
habit of taking in travellers, and his wife was about sick, but
if I was a mind to put up with common fare, he didn’t care.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
Grateful, I dismounted and took the seat he had vacated by
the fire, while he led away my horse to an open shed in the
rear—his own horse ranging at large, when not in use, during
the summer.</p>

<p>The house was all comprised in a single room, twenty-eight
by twenty-five feet in area, and open to the roof above.
There was a large fireplace at one end and a door on each
side—no windows at all. Two bedsteads, a spinning-wheel,
a packing-case, which served as a bureau, a cupboard, made
of rough hewn slabs, two or three deer-skin seated chairs, a
Connecticut clock, and a large poster of Jayne’s patent medicines,
constituted all the visible furniture, either useful or
ornamental in purpose. A little girl, immediately, without
having had any directions to do so, got a frying-pan and a
chunk of bacon from the cupboard, and cutting slices from the
latter, set it frying for my supper. The woman of the house
sat sulkily in a chair tilted back and leaning against the logs,
spitting occasionally at the fire, but took no notice of me,
barely nodding when I saluted her. A baby lay crying on
the floor. I quieted it and amused it with my watch till the
little girl, having made “coffee” and put a piece of corn-bread
on the table with the bacon, took charge of it.</p>

<p>I hoped the woman was not very ill.</p>

<p>“Got the headache right bad,” she answered. “Have the
headache a heap, I do. Knew I should have it to-night.
Been cuttin’ brush in the cotton this arternoon. Knew’t
would bring on my headache. Told him so when I begun.”</p>

<p>As soon as I had finished my supper and fed Jude, the
little girl put the fragments and the dishes in the cupboard,
shoved the table into a corner, and dragged a quantity of
quilts from one of the bedsteads, which she spread upon the
floor, and presently crawled among them out of sight for the
night. The woman picked up the child—which, though still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
a suckling, she said was twenty-two months old—and nursed
it, retaking her old position. The man sat with me by the
fire, his back towards her. The baby having fallen asleep
was laid away somewhere, and the woman dragged off another
lot of quilts from the beds, spreading them upon the floor.
Then taking a deep tin pan, she filled it with alternate layers
of corn-cobs and hot embers from the fire. This she placed
upon a large block, which was evidently used habitually for
the purpose, in the centre of the cabin. A furious smoke
arose from it, and we soon began to cough. “Most <i>too</i>
much smoke,” observed the man. “Hope ’twill drive out all
the gnats, then,” replied the woman. (There is a very minute
flying insect here, the bite of which is excessively sharp.)</p>

<p>The woman suddenly dropped off her outer garment and
stepped from the midst of its folds, in her petticoat; then,
taking the baby from the place where she had deposited it,
lay down and covered herself with the quilts upon the floor.
The man told me that I could take the bed which remained
on one of the bedsteads, and kicking off his shoes only, rolled
himself into a blanket by the side of his wife. I ventured to
take off my cravat and stockings, as well as my boots, but
almost immediately put my stockings on again, drawing their
tops over my pantaloons. The advantage of this arrangement
was that, although my face, eyes, ears, neck, and hands,
were immediately attacked, the vermin did not reach my legs
for two or three hours. Just after the clock struck two, I
distinctly heard the man and the woman, and the girl and
the dog scratching, and the horse out in the shed stamping
and gnawing himself. Soon afterward the man exclaimed,
“Good God Almighty—mighty! mighty! mighty!” and
jumping up pulled off one of his stockings, shook it, scratched
his foot vehemently, put on the stocking, and lay down
again with a groan. The two doors were open, and through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
the logs and the openings in the roof, I saw the clouds divide
and the moon and stars reveal themselves. The woman,
after having been nearly smothered by the smoke from the
pan which she had originally placed close to her own pillow,
rose and placed it on the sill of the windward door, where it
burned feebly and smoked lustily, like an altar to the Lares,
all night. Fortunately the cabin was so open that it gave us
little annoyance, while it seemed to answer the purpose of
keeping all flying insects at a distance.</p>

<p>When, on rising in the morning, I said that I would like
to wash my face, water was given me for the purpose in an
earthen pie-dish. Just as breakfast, which was of exactly
the same materials as my supper, was ready, rain began to
fall, presently in such a smart shower as to put the fire out
and compel us to move the table under the least leaky part of
the roof.</p>

<p>At breakfast occurred the following conversation:—</p>

<p>“Are there many niggers in New York?”</p>

<p>“Very few.”</p>

<p>“How do you get your work done?”</p>

<p>“There are many Irish and German people constantly
coming there who are glad to get work to do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and you have them for slaves?”</p>

<p>“They want money and are willing to work for it. A
great many American-born work for wages, too.”</p>

<p>“What do you have to pay?”</p>

<p>“Ten or twelve dollars a month.”</p>

<p>“There was a heap of Irishmen to work on the railroad;
they was paid a dollar a day; there was a good many
Americans, too, but mostly they had little carts and mules,
and hauled dirt and sich like. They was paid twenty-five
or thirty dollars a month and found.”</p>

<p>“What did they find them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, blanket and shoes, I expect; they put up kind o’
tents like for ’em to sleep in altogether.”</p>

<p>“What food did they find them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, common food; bacon and meal.”</p>

<p>“What do they generally give the niggers on the plantations
here?”</p>

<p>“A peck of meal and three pound of bacon is what they
call ’lowance, in general, I believe. It takes a heap o’ meat
on a big plantation. I was on one of William R. King’s
plantations over in Alabamy, where there was about fifty
niggers, one Sunday last summer, and I see ’em weighin’
outen the meat. Tell you, it took a powerful heap on it.
They had an old nigger to weigh it out, and he warn’t no
ways partickler about the weight. He just took and chopped
it off, middlins, in chunks, and he’d throw them into the scales,
and if a piece weighed a pound or two over he wouldn’t mind
it; he never took none back. Ain’t niggers all-fired sassy at
the North?”</p>

<p>“No, not particularly.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t they all free, there? I hearn so.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, how do they get along when they’s free?”</p>

<p>“I never have seen a great many, to know their circumstances
very well. Right about where I live they seem to
me to live quite comfortably; more so than the niggers on
these big plantations do, I should think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they have a mighty hard time on the big plantations.
I’d ruther be dead than to be a nigger on one of
these big plantations.”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought they were pretty well taken care of on
them.”</p>

<p>The man and his wife both looked at me as if surprised,
and smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>“Why, they are well fed, are they not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but they work em so hard. My God, sir, in pickin’
time on these plantations they start ’em to work ’fore light,
and they don’t give ’em time to eat.”</p>

<p>“I supposed they generally gave them an hour or two at
noon.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; they just carry a piece of bread and meat in
their pockets and they eat it when they can, standin’ up.
They have a hard life on ’t, that’s a fact. I reckon you can
get along about as well withouten slaves as with ’em, can’t
you, in New York?”</p>

<p>“In New York there is not nearly so large a proportion of
very rich men as here. There are very few people who farm
over three hundred acres, and the greater number—nineteen
out of twenty, I suppose—work themselves with the hands
they employ. Yes, I think it’s better than it is here, for all
concerned, a great deal. Folks that can’t afford to buy
niggers get along a great deal better in the Free States, I
think; and I guess that those who could afford to have
niggers get along better without them.”</p>

<p>“I no doubt that’s so. I wish there warn’t no niggers
here. They are a great cuss to this country, I expect. But
’twouldn’t do to free ’em; that wouldn’t do nohow!”</p>

<p>“Are there many people here who think slavery a curse to
the country?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, a great many. I reckon the majority would be
right glad if we could get rid of the niggers. But it wouldn’t
never do to free ’em and leave ’em here. I don’t know
anybody, hardly, in favour of that. Make ’em free and leave
’em here and they’d steal everything we made. Nobody
couldn’t live here then.”</p>

<p>These views of slavery seem to be universal among people of
this class. They were repeated to me at least a dozen times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>“Where I used to live [Alabama], I remember when I
was a boy—must ha’ been about twenty years ago—folks was
dreadful frightened about the niggers. I remember they
built pens in the woods where they could hide, and Christmas
time they went and got into the pens, ’fraid the niggers was
risin’.”</p>

<p>“I remember the same time where we was in South
Carolina,” said his wife; “we had all our things put up in bags,
so we could tote ’em, if we heerd they was comin’ our way.”</p>

<p>They did not suppose the niggers ever thought of rising
now, but could give no better reason for not supposing so than
that “everybody said there warn’t no danger on ’t now.”</p>

<p>Hereabouts the plantations were generally small, ten to
twenty negroes on each; sometimes thirty or forty. Where
he used to live they were big ones—forty or fifty, sometimes
a hundred on each. He had lived here ten years. I could
not make out why he had not accumulated wealth, so small a
family and such an inexpensive style of living as he had. He
generally planted twenty to thirty acres, he said; this year
he had sixteen in cotton and about ten, he thought, in corn.
Decently cultivated, this planting should have produced him
five hundred dollars’ worth of cotton, besides supplying him
with bread and bacon—his chief expense, apparently. I suggested
that this was a very large planting for his little
family; he would need some help in picking time. He
ought to have some now, he said; grass and bushes were all
overgrowing him; he had to work just like a nigger; this
durnation rain would just make the weeds jump, and he
didn’t expect he should have any cotton at all. There warn’t
much use in a man’s trying to get along by himself; every
thing seemed to set in agin him. He’d been trying to hire
somebody, but he couldn’t, and his wife was a sickly kind of
a woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>His wife reckoned he might hire some help if he’d look
round sharp.</p>

<p>My horse and dog were as well cared for as possible, and a
“snack” of bacon and corn-bread was offered me for noon,
which has been unusual in Mississippi. When I asked what
I should pay, the man hesitated and said he reckoned what I
had had, wasn’t worth much of anything; he was sorry he
could not have accommodated me better. I offered him a
dollar, for which he thanked me warmly. It is the first
instance of hesitation in charging for a lodging which I have
met with from a stranger at the South.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Northern Alabama, June 15th.</i>—I have to-day reached
a more distinctly hilly country—somewhat rocky and rugged,
but with inviting dells. The soil is sandy and less frequently
fertile; cotton-fields are seen only at long intervals, the
crops on the small proportion of cultivated land being chiefly
corn and oats. I notice also that white men are more commonly
at work in the fields than negroes, and this as well
in the cultivation of cotton as of corn.</p>

<p>The larger number of the dwellings are rude log huts, of
only one room, and that unwholesomely crowded. I saw in
and about one of them, not more than fifteen feet square, five
grown persons, and as many children. Occasionally, however,
the monotony of these huts is agreeably varied by neat,
white, frame houses. At one such, I dined to-day, and was
comfortably entertained. The owner held a number of slaves,
but made no cotton. He owned a saw mill, was the postmaster
of the neighbourhood, and had been in the Legislature.</p>

<p>I asked him why the capital had been changed from Tuscaloosa
to Montgomery. He did not know. “Because Montgomery
is more central and easy of access, probably,” I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
suggested. “No, I don’t think that had anything to do
with it.” “Is Tuscaloosa an unhealthy place?” “No, sir;
healthier than Montgomery, I reckon.” “Was it then
simply because the people of the southern districts were
stronger, and used their power to make the capital more convenient
of access to themselves?” “Well, no, I don’t think
that was it, exactly. The fact is, sir, the people here are not
like you northern people; they don’t reason out everything
so. They are fond of change, and they got tired of Tuscaloosa;
the Montgomery folks wanted it there and offered to
pay for moving it, so they let ’em have it; ’t was just for a
change.” “If there really was no better reason, was it not
rather wasteful to give up all the public buildings at Tuscaloosa?”
“Oh, the Montgomery people wanted it so bad they
promised to pay for building a new State House; so it did
not cost anything.”</p>

<p>Quite on a par with the economics of southern commercial
conventions.</p>

<p>I passed the night at the second framed house that I saw
during the day, stopping early in order to avail myself of its
promise of comfort. It was attractively situated on a hilltop,
with a peach orchard near it. The proprietor owned a
dozen slaves, and “made cotton,” he said, “with other crops.”
He had some of his neighbours at tea and at breakfast;
sociable, kindly people, satisfied with themselves and their
circumstances, which I judged from their conversation had
been recently improving. One coming in, remarked that he
had discharged a white labourer whom he had employed for
some time past; the others congratulated him on being
“shet” of him; all seemed to have noticed him as a bad,
lazy man; he had often been seen lounging in the field,
rapping the negroes with his hoe if they didn’t work to suit
him. “He was about the meanest white man I ever see,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
said a woman; “he was a heap meaner ’n niggers. I reckon
niggers would come somewhere between white folks and such
as he.” “The first thing I tell a man,” said another, “when
I hire him, is, ‘if there’s any whippin’ to be done on this
place I want to do it myself.’ If I saw a man rappin’ my
niggers with a hoe-handle, as I see him, durned if I wouldn’t
rap him—the lazy whelp.”</p>

<p>One of the negroes complimented my horse. “Dar’s a
heap of genus in dat yar hoss’s head!” The proprietor looked
after the feeding himself.</p>

<p>These people were extremely kind; inquiring with the simplest
good feeling about my domestic relations and the purpose
of my journey. When I left, one of them walked a quarter of
a mile to make sure that I went upon the right road. The
charge for entertainment, though it was unusually good, was
a quarter of a dollar less than I have paid before, which I
mention, not as Mr. De Bow would suppose,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> out of gratitude
for the moderation, but as an indication of the habits of
the people, showing, as it may, either closer calculation, or
that the district grows its own supplies, and can furnish food
cheaper than those in which attention is more exclusively
given to cotton.</p>

<p><i>June 17th.</i>—The country continues hilly, and is well populated
by farmers, living in log huts, while every mile or two,
on the more level and fertile land, there is a larger farm, with
ten or twenty negroes at work. A few whites are usually
working near them, in the same field, generally ploughing
while the negroes hoe.</p>

<p>About noon, my attention was attracted towards a person
upon a ledge, a little above the road, who was throwing up
earth and stone with a shovel. I stopped to see what the
purpose of this work might be, and perceived that the shoveller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
was a woman, who, presently discovering me, stopped and
called to others behind her, and immediately a stout girl and
two younger children, with a man, came to the edge and
looked at me. The woman was bareheaded, and otherwise
half-naked, as perhaps needed to be, for her work would have
been thought hard by our stoutest labourers, and it was the
hottest weather of the summer, in the latitude of Charleston,
and on a hill-side in the full face of the noon sun. I pushed
my horse up the hill until I reached them, when another man
appeared, and in answer to my inquiries told me that they
were getting out iron ore. One was picking in a vein, having
excavated a short adit; the other man picked looser ore exterior
to the vein. The women and children shovelled out the
ore and piled it on kilns of timber, where they roasted it to
make it crumble. It was then carted to a forge, and they
were paid for it by the load. They were all clothed very
meanly and scantily. The women worked, so far as I could
see, as hard as the men. The children, too, even to the
youngest—a boy of eight or ten—were carrying large lumps
of ore, and heaving them into the kiln, and shovelling the
finer into a screen to separate the earth from it.</p>

<p>Immediately after leaving them I found a good spot for
nooning. I roped my horse out to graze, and spread my
blanket in a deep shade. I noticed that the noise of their
work had ceased, and about fifteen minutes afterwards, Jude
suddenly barking, I saw one of the men peering at me
through the trees, several rods distant. I called to him
to come up. He approached rather slowly and timidly,
examined the rope with which my horse was fastened, eyed
me vigilantly, and at length asked if I was resting myself.
I replied that I was; and he said that he did not know but
I might be sick, and had come to see me. I thanked him,
and offered him a seat upon my blanket, which he declined.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
Presently he took up a newspaper that I had been reading,
looked at it for a moment, then he told me he couldn’t read.
“Folks don’t care much for edication round here; it would be
better for ’em, I expect, if they did.” He began then to
question me closely about my circumstances—where I came
from, whither I was going, etc.</p>

<p>When his curiosity was partially appeased he suddenly
laughed in a silly manner, and said that the people he had been
working with had watched me after I left them; they saw me
ride up the hill and stop, ride on again, and finally take off my
saddle, turn my horse loose and tote my saddle away, and they
were much frightened, thinking I must be crazy at least. When
he started to come toward me they told him he wouldn’t dare
to go to me, but he saw how it was, well enough—I was just
resting myself.</p>

<p>“If I should run down hill now,” said he, “they’d start
right off and wouldn’t stop for ten mile, reckoning you was
arter me. That would be fun; oh, we have some good fun
here sometimes with these green folks. There’s an amazin’
ignorant set round here.”</p>

<p>I asked if they were foreigners.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; they are common, no account people; they used
to live over the hill, here; they come right nigh starvin’ thar,
I expect.”</p>

<p>They had not been able to get any work to do, and had
been “powerful poor,” until he got them to come here.
They had taken an old cabin, worked with him, and were
doing right well now. He didn’t let them work in the vein—he
kept that for himself—but they worked all around, and
some days they made a dollar and a half—the man, woman,
and children together. They had one other girl, but she
had to stay at home to take care of the baby and keep cattle
and hogs out of their “gardien.” He had known the woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
when she was a girl; “she was always a good one to work.
She’d got a voice like a bull, and she was as smart as a wild
cat; but the man warn’t no account.”</p>

<p>He had himself followed this business (mining) since he was
a young man, and could earn three dollars a day by it if he
tried; he had a large family and owned a small farm: never
laid up anything, always kept himself a little in debt at the
store.</p>

<p>He asked if I had not found the people “more friendly
like” up in this country to what they were down below, and
assured me that I would find them grow more friendly as I went
further North, so at least he had heard, and he knew where
he first came from (Tennessee) the people were more friendly
than they were here. “The richer a man is,” he continued,
pursuing a natural association of ideas, “and the more niggers
he’s got, the poorer he seems to live. If you want to
fare well in this country you stop to poor folks’ housen; they
try to enjoy what they’ve got, while they ken, but these yer
big planters they don’ care for nothing but to save. Now,
I never calculate to save anything; I tell my wife I work
hard, and I mean to enjoy what I earn as fast as it comes.”</p>

<p>Sometimes he “took up bee-huntin’ for a spell,” and made
money by collecting wild honey. He described his manner of
finding the hives and securing the honey, and, with a hushed
voice, told me a “secret,” which was, that if you carried three
leaves, each of a different tree (?) in your hand, there was
never a bee would dare to sting you.</p>

<p>I asked about his children. He had one grown-up son,
who was doing very well; he was hired by the gentleman
who owned the forge, to cart ore. He had nothing to do but
to drive a team; he didn’t have to load, and he had a nigger
to take care of the horses when his day’s teaming was done.</p>

<p>His wages were seven dollars a month, and board for himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
and wife. They ate at the same table with the gentleman,
and had good living, beside having something out of the store,
“tobacco and so on—tobacco for both on ’em, and two
people uses a good deal of tobacco you know; so that’s pretty
good wages—seven dollars a month besides their keep and
tobacco.” Irishmen, he informed me, had been employed
occasionally at the forge. “They do well at first, only they
is apt to get into fights all the time; but after they’ve been
here a year or two, they get to feel so independent and keerless-like,
you can’t get along with ’em.” He remained about
half an hour, and not till he returned did I hear again the
noise of picking and shovelling, and cutting timber.</p>

<p>At the forges, I was told, slave labour is mainly employed—the
slaves being owned by the proprietors of the forges.</p>

<p>I spent that night at a large inn in a village. In the
morning as I sat waiting in my room, a boy opened the door.
Without looking up I asked, “Well?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say nuthin’, sar,” with a great grin.</p>

<p>“What are you waiting there for?” “Please, massa, I
b’leve yours owin’ me suthin’, sar.” “Owing you something?
What do you mean?” “For drying yer clothes for yer, sar,
last night.” I had ordered him immediately after tea to go
up stairs and get my clothes, which had been drenched in a
shower, and hang them by the kitchen fire, that they might
be dry if I should wish to leave early in the morning. When
I went to my bedroom at nine o’clock I found the clothes
where I had left them. I went down and reported it to the
landlord, who directly sent the boy for them. In the morning,
when I got them again I found they were not dry except
where they were burned. I told him to be gone; but with
the door half open, he stood putting in his head, bowing and
grinning. “Please, sar, massa sent me out of an errand,
and I was afeard you would be gone before I got back; dat’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
the reason why I mention it, sar; dat’s all, sar; I hope you’ll
skuse me, sar.”</p>

<p>During the afternoon I rode on through a valley, narrow
and apparently fertile, but the crops indifferent. The general
social characteristics were the same that I met with yesterday.</p>

<p>At night I stopped at a large house having an unusual
number of negro cabins and stables about it. The proprietor,
a hearty old farmer, boasted much of his pack of hounds,
saying they had pulled down five deer before he had had a
shot at them. He was much interested to hear about Texas,
the Indians and the game. He reckoned there was “a heap
of big varmint out thar.”</p>

<p>His crop of cotton did not average two bales to the hand,
and corn not twenty bushels to the acre.</p>

<p>He amused me much with a humorous account of an oyster
supper to which he had been invited in town, and his attempts
to eat the “nasty things” without appearing disconcerted
before the ladies.</p>

<p>An old negro took my horse when I arrived, and half an
hour afterward, came to me and asked if I wanted to see him
fed. As we walked toward the stables, he told me that he
always took care not to forget gentlemen’s hosses, and to treat
them well; “then,” he said, bowing and with emphasis,
“they looks out and don’t forget to treat me well.”</p>

<p>The same negro was called to serve me as a candlestick at
bedtime. He held the candle till I got into bed. As he retired
I closed my eyes, but directly afterward, perceiving the
light return, I opened them. Uncle Abram was bending
over me, holding the candle, grinning with his toothless gums,
winking and shaking his head in a most mysterious manner.</p>

<p>“Hush! massa,” he whispered. “You hain’t got something
to drink, in dem saddle-bags, has you, sar?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>The farmer told me something about “nigger dogs” they
didn’t use foxhounds, but bloodhounds—not pure, he thought,
but a cross of the Spanish bloodhound with the common
hounds, or curs. There were many men, he said, in the
country below here, who made a business of nigger-hunting,
and they had their horses trained, as well as the dogs, to go
over any common fence, or if they couldn’t leap it, to break it
down. Dogs were trained, when pups, to follow a nigger—not
allowed to catch one, however, unless they were quite
young, so that they couldn’t hurt him much, and they were
always taught to hate a negro, never being permitted to see
one except to be put in chase of him. He believed that only
two of a pack were kept kenneled all the time—these were old,
keen ones, who led the rest when they were out; they were
always kept coupled together with a chain, except when trailing.
He had seen a pack of thirteen who would follow a
trail two days and a half old, if rain had not fallen in the
mean time. When it rained immediately after a negro got
off, they had to scour the country where they supposed he
might be, till they scented him.</p>

<p>When hard pushed, a negro always took to a tree; sometimes,
however, they would catch him in an open field. When
this was the case the hunter called off the dogs as soon as he
could, unless the negro fought—“that generally makes ’em
mad (the hunters), and they’ll let ’em tear him a spell. The
owners don’t mind having them kind o’ niggers tore a good
deal; runaways ain’t much account nohow, and it makes the
rest more afraid to run away, when they see how they are
sarved.” If they caught the runaway within two or three
days, they got from $10 to $20; if it took a longer time,
they were paid more than that; sometimes $200. They
asked their own price; if an owner should think it exorbitant,
he supposed, he said in reply to an inquiry, they’d turn the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
nigger loose, order him to make off, and tell his master to
catch his own niggers.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Sunday.</i>—I rode on, during the cool of the morning, about
eight miles, and stopped for the day, at a house pleasantly
situated by a small stream, among wooded hills. During the
forenoon, seven men and three women, with their children,
gathered at the house. All of them, I concluded, were non-slaveholders,
as was our host himself; though, as one told
me, “with his five boys he makes a heap more crop than
Mrs. ——, who’s got forty niggers.” “How is that?” “Well,
she’s a woman, and she can’t make the niggers work; she
won’t have a overseer, and niggers won’t work, you know,
unless there’s somebody to drive ’em.”</p>

<p>Our host, when I arrived, had just been pulling weeds out
of his potato patch, which he mentioned as an apology for not
being a little clean, like the rest.</p>

<p>Beside the company I have mentioned, and the large family
of the house, there was another traveller and myself to
dinner, and three bountiful tables were spread, one after
another.</p>

<p>The traveller was said to be a Methodist preacher, but
gave no indication of it, except that he said grace before meat,
and used the Hebrew word for Sunday. He was, however, a
man of superior intelligence to the others, who were ignorant
and stupid, though friendly and communicative. He asked
me “what a good nigger man could be bought for in New
York;” he didn’t seem surprised, or make any further inquiry,
when I told him we had no slaves there. Some asked me
much about crops, and when I told them that my crops of
wheat for six years had averaged twenty-eight bushels, and
that I had once reaped forty from a single acre, they were
amazed beyond expression, and anxious to know how I “put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
it in.” I described the process minutely, which astonished
them still more; and one man said he had often thought they
might get more wheat if they put it in differently; he had
thought that perhaps more wheat would grow if more seed
were sown, but he never tried it. The general practice, they
told me, was to sow wheat on ground from which they had
taken maize, without removing the maize stumps, or ploughing
it at all; they sowed three pecks of wheat to the acre, and
then ploughed it in—that was all. They used the cradle, but
had never heard of reaping machines; the crop was from five
to ten bushels an acre; ten bushels was extraordinary, six was
not thought bad. Of cotton, the ordinary crop was five
hundred pounds to the acre, or from one to two bales to a
hand. Of maize, usually from ten to twenty bushels to the
acre; last year not over ten; this year they thought it would
be twenty-five on the best land.</p>

<p>The general admiration of Jude brought up the topic of
negro dogs again, and the clergyman told a story of a man
who hunted niggers near where he lived. He was out once
with another man, when after a long search, they found the
dogs barking up a big cottonwood tree. They examined the
tree closely without finding any negro, and concluded that
the dogs must have been foiled, and they were about to go
away, when Mr. ——, from some distance off, thought he saw
a negro’s leg very high up in the tree, where the leaves and
moss were thick enough to hide a man lying on the top of a
limb with his feet against the trunk. He called out, as if he
really saw a man, telling him to come down, but nothing
stirred. He sent for an axe, and called out again, saying he
would cut the tree to the ground if he didn’t come down.
There was no reply. He then cut half through the tree on
one side, and was beginning on the other, when the negro
halloed out that if he would stop he would come down. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
stopped cutting, and the negro descended to the lowest limb,
which was still far from the ground, and asked the hunter to
take away his dogs, and promise they shouldn’t tear him.
But the hunter swore he’d make no conditions with him after
having been made to cut the tree almost down.</p>

<p>The negro said no more, but retained his position until the
tree was nearly cut in two. When it began to totter, he slid
down the trunk, the dogs springing upon him as soon as he
was within their reach. He fought them hard, and got hold
of one by the ear; that made them fiercer, and they tore him
till the hunter was afraid they’d kill him, and stopped them.</p>

<p>“Are dogs allowed to tear the negroes when they catch them?”</p>

<p>“When the hunters come up they always call them off,
unless the nigger fights. If the nigger fights ’em that makes
’em mad, and they let ’em tear him good,” said the clergyman.</p>

<p>There were two or three young women present, and the
young men were sparking with them in the house, sitting on
the beds for want of sofas, the chairs being all in use outside;
the rest of the company sat on the gallery most of the time,
but there was little conversation. It was twice remarked to
me, “Sunday’s a dull day—nothing to do.”</p>

<p>As the Methodist and I were reading after dinner, I
noticed that two or three were persuading the others to go
with them somewhere, and I asked where they purposed to go.
They said they wanted to go over the mountain to hunt a bull.</p>

<p>“To shoot him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, it’s a working bull; they got his mate yesterday.
There ain’t but one pair of cattle in this neighbourhood, and
they do all the hauling for nine families.” They belonged,
together with their waggon, to one man, and the rest borrowed
of him. They wanted them this week to cart in their oats.
The stray bull was driven in toward night, yoked with another
to a waggon, and one of the women, with her family, got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
into the waggon and was carried home. The bulls were
fractious and had to be led by one man, while another urged
them forward with a cudgel.</p>

<p>Last night by the way a neighbour came into the house of
Uncle Abram’s master, and in the course of conversation about
crops, said that on Sunday he went over to John Brown’s to
get him to come out and help him at his harvesting. He
found four others there for the same purpose, but John said
he didn’t feel well, and he reckoned he couldn’t work. He
offered him a dollar and a half a day to cradle for him; but
when he tried to persuade him, John spoke out plainly and
said, “he’d be d—d if he was going to work anyhow;” so he
said to the others, “Come, boys, we may as well go; you can’t
make a lazy man work when he’s determined he won’t.” He
supposed that remark made him mad, for on Thursday John
came running across his cotton patch, where he was ploughing.
He didn’t speak a word to him, but cut along over to
his neighbour’s house, and told him that he had shot two
deer, and wanted his hounds to catch ’em, promising to give
him half the venison if he succeeded. He did catch one of
them, and kept his promise.</p>

<p>This man Brown, they told me, had a large family, and
lived in a little cabin on the mountain. He pretended to
plant a corn patch, but he never worked it, and didn’t make
any corn. They reckoned he lived pretty much on what corn
and hogs he could steal, and on game. The children were
described as pitiably, “scrawny,” half-starved little wretches.
Last summer his wife had come to one of them, saying they
had no corn, and she wanted to pick cotton to earn some.
He had let her go in with the niggers and pick. She kept at
it for two days, and took her pay in corn. Afterward he saw
her little boy “toting” it to the mill to be ground—much too
heavy a load for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>I asked if there were many such vagabonds.</p>

<p>“Yes, a great many on the mountain, and they make a
heap of trouble. There is a law by which they might be
taken up [if it could be proved that they have no ‘visible
means of support’] and made to work to support their
families; but the law is never used.”</p>

<p>Speaking of another man, one said: “He’ll be here to
breakfast, at your house to dinner, and at Dr. ——’s to
supper, leaving his family to live as best they can.” They
“reckoned” he got most of his living in that way, while his
family had to get theirs by stealing. He never did any work
except hunting, and they “reckoned” he killed about as
many shoats and yearlings as deer and turkeys.</p>

<p>They said that this sort of people were not often intemperate;
they had no money to buy liquor with; now and
then, when they’d sold some game or done a little work to
raise money, they’d have a spree; but they were more apt to
gamble it off or spend it for fine clothes and things to trick
out their wives.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>June —.</i> To-day, I am passing through a valley of thin,
sandy soil, thickly populated by poor farmers. Negroes are
rare, but occasionally neat, new houses, with other improvements,
show the increasing prosperity of the district.
The majority of dwellings are small log cabins of one room,
with another separate cabin for a kitchen; each house has a
well, and a garden inclosed with palings. Cows, goats, mules
and swine, fowls and doves are abundant. The people are
more social than those of the lower country, falling readily
into friendly conversation with a traveller. They are very
ignorant; the agriculture is wretched and the work hard. I
have seen three white women hoeing field crops to-day. A
spinning-wheel is heard in every house, and frequently a loom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
is clanging in the gallery, always worked by women; every
one wears homespun. The negroes have much more individual
freedom than in the rich cotton country, and are not unfrequently
heard singing or whistling at their work.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Tennessee, June 29th.</i>—At nightfall I entered a broader and
more populous valley than I had seen before during the day,
but for some time there were only small single room log
cabins, at which I was loath to apply for lodging. At length I
reached a large and substantial log house with negro cabins.
The master sat in the stoop. I asked if he could accommodate me.</p>

<p>“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“Something to eat for myself and horse, and room to sleep
under your roof.”</p>

<p>“The wust on’t is,” he said, getting up and coming toward
me, “we haven’t got much for your horse.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got corn, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“No, hain’t got no corn but a little that we want for ourselves,
only just enough to bread us till corn comes again.”</p>

<p>“Well, you have oats?”</p>

<p>“Hain’t got an oat.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you hay?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then I must go further, for my horse can’t travel on
fodder.”</p>

<p>“Hain’t got nary fodder nuther.”</p>

<p>Fortunately I did not have to go much farther before I
came to the best house I had seen during the day, a large,
neat, white house, with negro shanties, and an open log cabin
in the front yard. A stout, elderly, fine-looking woman, in
a cool white muslin dress sat upon the gallery, fanning
herself. Two little negroes had just brought a pail of fresh
water, and she was drinking of it with a gourd, as I came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
the gate. I asked if it would be convenient for her to
accommodate me for the night, doubtingly, for I had learned to
distrust the accommodations of the wealthy slaveholders.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, get down; fasten your horse there, and the
niggers will take care of him when they come from their work.
Come up here and take a seat.”</p>

<p>I brought in my saddle-bags.</p>

<p>“Bring them in here, into the parlour,” she said, “where
they’ll be safe.”</p>

<p>The interior of the house was furnished with unusual
comfort. “The parlour,” however, had a bed in it. As we
came out, she locked the door.</p>

<p>We had not sat long, talking about the weather (she was
suffering much from the heat), when her husband came. He
was very hot also, though dressed coolly enough in merely a
pair of short-legged, unbleached cotton trousers, and a shirt
with the bosom spread open—no shoes nor stockings. He
took his seat before speaking to me, and after telling his wife
it was the hottest day he ever saw, squared his chair toward
me, threw it back so as to recline against a post, and said
gruffly, “Good evening, sir; you going to stay here to-night?”</p>

<p>I replied, and he looked at me a few moments without
speaking. He was, in fact, so hot that he spoke with difficulty.
At length he got breath and asked abruptly: “You a
mechanic, sir, or a dentist, eh—or what?”</p>

<p>Supper was cooked by two young women, daughters of the
master of the house, assisted by the two little negro boys.
The cabin in front of the house was the kitchen, and when
the bacon was dished up, one of the boys struck an iron
triangle at the door. “Come to supper,” said the host, and
led the way to the kitchen, which was also the supper-room.
One of the young ladies took the foot of the table, the other
seated herself apart by the fire, and actually waited on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
table, though the two negro boys stood at the head and foot,
nominally waiters, but always anticipated by the Cinderella,
when anything was wanted.</p>

<p>A big lout of a youth who came from the field with the
negroes, looked in, but seeing me, retired. His father called, but
his mother said, “’t wouldn’t do no good—he was so bashful.”</p>

<p>Speaking of the climate of the country, I was informed
that a majority of the folks went barefoot all winter, though
they had snow much of the time four or five inches deep, and
the man said he didn’t think most of the men about here had
more than one coat, and they never wore any in winter except
on holidays. “That was the healthiest way,” he reckoned,
“just to toughen yourself and not wear no coat; no matter
how cold it was, he didn’t wear no coat.”</p>

<p>The master held a candle for me while I undressed, in a
large room above stairs; and gave me my choice of the four
beds in it. I found one straw bed (with, as usual, but one
sheet), on which I slept comfortably. At midnight I was
awakened by some one coming in. I rustled my straw, and
a voice said, “Who is there in this room?”</p>

<p>“A stranger passing the night; who are you?”</p>

<p>“All right; I belong here. I’ve been away and have just
come home.”</p>

<p>He did not take his clothes off to sleep. He turned out to
be an older son who had been fifty miles away, looking after
a stray horse. When I went down stairs in the morning,
having been wakened early by flies, and the dawn of day
through an open window, I saw the master lying on his bed
in the “parlour,” still asleep in the clothes he wore at supper.
His wife was washing her face on the gallery, being already
dressed for the day; after using the family towel, she went
into the kitchen, but soon returned, smoking a pipe, to her
chair in the doorway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>Yet everything betokened an opulent and prosperous man—rich
land, extensive field crops, a number of negroes, and
considerable herds of cattle and horses. He also had capital
invested in mines and railroads, he told me. His elder son
spoke of him as “the squire.”</p>

<p>A negro woman assisted in preparing breakfast (she had
probably been employed in the field labour the night before),
and both the young ladies were at the table. The squire observed
to me that he supposed we could buy hands very cheap
in New York. I said we could hire them there at moderate
wages. He asked if we couldn’t buy as many as we wanted,
by sending to Ireland for them and paying their passage.
He had supposed we could buy them and hold them as slaves
for a term of years, by paying the freight on them. When I
had corrected him, he said, a little hesitatingly, “You don’t
have no black slaves in New York?” “No, sir.” “There’s
niggers there, ain’t there, only they’re all free?” “Yes, sir.”
“Well, how do they get along so?” “So far as I know, the
most of them live pretty comfortably.” (I have changed my
standard of comfort lately, and am inclined to believe that the
majority of the negroes at the North live more comfortably
than the majority of whites at the South.) “I wouldn’t like
that,” said the old lady. “I wouldn’t like to live where
niggers was free, they are bad enough when they are slaves:
it’s hard enough to get along with them here, they’re so bad.
I reckon that niggers are the meanest critters on earth; they
are so mean and nasty” (she expressed disgust and indignation
very strongly in her face). “If they was to think themselves
equal to we, I don’t think white folks could abide it—they’re
such vile saucy things.” A negro woman and two
boys were in the room, as she said this.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>North Carolina, July 13th.</i>—I rode late last night, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
being no cabins for several miles in which I was willing to
spend the night, until I came to one of larger size than
usual, with a gallery on the side toward the road and a good
stable opposite it. A man on the gallery was about to answer
(as I judged from his countenance), “I reckon you can,” to
my inquiry if I could stay, when the cracked voice of a
worryful woman screeched out from within, “We don’t foller
takin’ in people.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said the man, “we don’t foller it.”</p>

<p>“How far shall I have to go?”</p>

<p>“There’s another house a little better than three quarters of
a mile further on.”</p>

<p>To this house I proceeded—a cabin of one room and a loft,
with a kitchen in a separate cabin. The owner said he never
turned anybody away, and I was welcome. He did not say
that he had no corn, until after supper, when I asked for it
to feed my horse. The family were good-natured, intelligent
people, but very ignorant. The man and his wife and the
daughters slept below, the boy and I in the cock-loft. Supper
and breakfast were eaten in the detached kitchen. Yet they
were by no means poor people. The man told me that he
had over a thousand acres of rich tillable land, besides a large
extent of mountain range, the most of which latter he had
bought from time to time as he was able, to prevent the
settlement of squatters near his valley-land. “There were
people who would be bad neighbours, I knew,” he said, “that
would settle on most any kind of place, and everybody wants
to keep such as far away from them as they can.” (When I
took my bridle off, I hung it up by the stable-door; he took
it down and said he’d hang it in a safer place. “He’d never
had anything stolen from here, and he didn’t mean to have—it
was just as well not to put temptation before people,” and
he took it into the house and put it under his bed.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>Besides this large tract of land here, he owned another
tract of two hundred acres with a house upon it, rented for
one-third the produce, and another smaller farm, similarly
rented; he also owned a grist mill, which he rented to a
miller for half the tolls. He told me that he had thought a
good deal formerly of moving to new countries, but he had
been doing pretty well and had stayed here now so long, he
didn’t much think he should ever budge. He reckoned he’d
got enough to make him a living for the rest of his life, and
he didn’t know any use a man had for more’n that.</p>

<p>I did not see a single book in the house, nor do I think
that any of the family could read. He said that many people
here were talking about Iowa and Indiana; “was Iowa
(Hiaway) beyond the Texies?” I opened my map to show
him where it was, but he said he “wasn’t scollar’d enough”
to understand it, and I could not induce him to look at it. I
asked him if the people here preferred Iowa and Indiana to
Missouri at all because they were Free States. “I reckon,”
he replied, “they don’t have no allusion to that. Slavery is
a great cuss, though, I think, the greatest there is in these
United States. There ain’t no account of slaves up here in
the west, but down in the east part of this State about
Fayetteville there’s as many as there is in South Carolina.
That’s the reason the West and the East don’t agree in this
State; people out here hates the Eastern people.”</p>

<p>“Why is that?”</p>

<p>“Why you see they vote on the slave basis, and there’s
some of them nigger counties where there ain’t more’n four or
five hundred white folks, that has just as much power in the
Legislature as any of our mountain counties where there’ll be
some thousand voters.”</p>

<p>He made further remarks against slavery and against slaveholders.
When I told him that I entirely agreed with him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
and said further, that poor white people were usually far
better off in the Free than in the Slave States, he seemed a
little surprised and said, “New York ain’t a Free State, is it?”</p>

<p>Labourers’ wages here, he stated, were from fifty cents to
one dollar a day, or eight dollars a month. “How much by
the year?” “They’s never lured by the year.”</p>

<p>“Would it be $75 a year?”</p>

<p>“’Twouldn’t be over that, anyhow, but ’tain’t general
for people to hire here only for harvest time; fact is, a man
couldn’t earn his board, let alone his wages, for six months
in the year.”</p>

<p>“But what do these men who hire out during harvest time
do during the rest of the year; do they have to earn enough
in those two or three months to live on for the other eight or
nine?”</p>

<p>“Well, they gets jobs sometimes, and they goes from one
place to another.”</p>

<p>“But in winter time, when you say there’s not work
enough to pay their board?”</p>

<p>“Well, they keeps a goin’ round from one place to another,
and gets their living somehow.”</p>

<p>“The fact on’t is,” he said at length, as I pressed the
inquiry, “there ain’t anybody that ever means to work any
in this country, except just along in harvest—folks don’t keep
working here as they do in your country, I expect.”</p>

<p>“But they must put in their crops?”</p>

<p>“Yes, folks that have farms of their own, they do put in
their craps and tend ’em, but these fellows that don’t have
farms, they won’t work except in harvest, when they can get
high wages [$8 a month]. I hired a fellow last spring for
six months; I wanted him to help me plant and tend my corn.
You see I had a short crap last year, and this spring I had
to pay fifty cents a bushel for corn for bread, and I didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
want to get caught so again, not this year, so I gin this fellow
$6 a month for six months—$36 I gin him in hard silver.”</p>

<p>“Paid it to him in advance?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he wouldn’t come ’less I’d pay him right then.
Well, he worked one month, and maybe eight days—no, I
don’t think it was more than six days over a month, and then
he went away, and I hain’t seen a sight on him since. I
expect I shall lose my money—reckon he don’t ever intend to
come back; he knows I’m right in harvest, and want him
now, if ever I do.”</p>

<p>“What did he go away for?”</p>

<p>“Why, he said he was sick, but if he was, he got well
mighty easy after he stopped working.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where he is now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he’s going round here.”</p>

<p>“What is he doing?”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s just goin’ round.”</p>

<p>“Is he at work for any one else?”</p>

<p>“Reckon not—no, he’s just goin’ round from one place to
another.”</p>

<p>At supper and breakfast surprise was expressed that I
declined coffee, and more still that I drank water instead of
milk. The woman observed, “’twas cheap boarding me.”
The man said he must get home a couple more cows; they
ought to drink milk more, coffee was so high now, and he
believed milk would be just as healthy. The woman asked
the price of coffee in New York; I could not tell her, but said
I believed it was uncommonly high; the crops had been
short. She asked how coffee grew. I told her as well as I
was able, but concluded by saying I had never seen it growing.
“Don’t you raise coffee in New York?” she asked;
“I thought that was where it came from.”</p>

<p>The butter was excellent. I said so, and asked if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
never made any for sale. The woman said she could make
“as good butter as any ever was made in the yarth, but she
couldn’t get anything for it; there warn’t many of the merchants
would buy it, and those that did, would only take it at
eight cents a pound for goods.” The man said the only
thing he could ever sell for ready money was cattle. Drovers
bought them for the New York market, and lately they were
very high—four cents a pound. He had driven cattle all the
way to Charleston himself, to sell them, and only got four
cents a pound there. He had sold corn here for twelve and
a half cents a bushel.</p>

<p>Although the man could not read, he had honoured letters
by calling one of his children “Washington Irving;” another
was known as Matterson (Madison?). He had never tried
manuring land for crops, but said, “I do believe it is a good
plan, and if I live I mean to try it sometime.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>July 16th.</i>—I stopped last night at the pleasantest house
I have yet seen in the highlands; a framed house, painted
white, with a log kitchen attached. The owner was a man
of superior standing. I judged from the public documents
and law books on his table, that he had either been in the
Legislature of the State, or that he was a justice of the peace.
There were also a good many other books and newspapers,
chiefly of a religious character. He used, however, some
singularly uncouth phrases common here. He had a store,
and carried on farming and stock raising. After a conversation
about his agriculture, I remarked that there were but
few slaves in this part of the country. He wished that there
were fewer. They were not profitable property here, I presumed.
They were not, he said, except to raise for sale;
but there were a good many people here who would not have
them if they were profitable, and yet who were abundantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
able to buy them. They were horrid things, he thought; he
would not take one to keep it if it should be given to him.
’Twould be a great deal better for the country, he believed, if
there was not a slave in it. He supposed it would not be
right to take them away from those who had acquired property
in them, without any remuneration, but he wished they
could all be sent out of the country—sent to Liberia. That
was what ought to be done with them. I said it was evident
that where there were no slaves, other things being equal,
there was greater prosperity than where slavery supplied the
labour. He didn’t care so much for that, he said; there was
a greater objection to slavery than that, in his mind. He was
afraid that there was many a man who had gone to the bad
world, who wouldn’t have gone there if he hadn’t had any
slaves. He had been down in the nigger counties a good
deal, and he had seen how it worked on the white people.
It made the rich people, who owned the niggers, passionate
and proud, and ugly, and it made the poor people mean.
“People that own niggers are always mad with them about
something; half their time is spent in swearing and yelling
at them.”</p>

<p>“I see you have ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ here,” said I;
“have you read it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“And what do you think of it?”</p>

<p>“Think of it? I think well of it.”</p>

<p>“Do most of the people here in the mountains think as
you do about slavery?”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s some thinks one way and some another, but
there’s hardly any one here that don’t think slavery’s a curse
to our country, or who wouldn’t be glad to get rid of it.”</p>

<p>I asked what the people about here thought of the Nebraska
Bill. He couldn’t say what the majority thought.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
Would people moving from here to Nebraska now, be likely
to vote for the admission of slavery there? He thought not;
“most people would much rather live in a Free State.” He
told me that he knew personally several persons who had
gone to California, and taken slaves with them, who had not
been able to bring them back. There were one or two cases
where the negroes had been induced to return, and these
instances had been made much of in the papers, as evidence
that the slaves were contented.</p>

<p>“That’s a great lie,” he said; “they are not content, and
nine-tenths of ’em would do ’most anything to be free. It’s
only now and then that slaves, who are treated unusual kind,
and made a great deal of, will choose to remain in slavery
if freedom is put in their way.” He knew one man (giving
his name) who tried to bring two slaves back from California,
and had got started with them, when some white people suspecting
it, went on board the ship and told him it was against
the law to hold negroes as slaves in California, and his negroes
shouldn’t go back with him unless they were willing to.
Then they went to the slaves and told them they need not
return if they preferred to stay, and the slaves said they had
wanted very much to go back to North Carolina, yet they
would rather remain in California, if they could be free, and
so they took them ashore. He had heard the slave owner
himself relating this, and cursing the men who interfered.
He had told him that they did no more than Christians were
obliged to do.</p>

<p>I overtook upon the road, to-day, three young men of the
poorest class. Speaking of the price of land and the profit of
farming, one of them said, believing me to be a southerner—</p>

<p>“We are all poor folks here; don’t hardly make enough to
keep us in liquor. Anybody can raise as much corn and hogs
on the mountains as he’ll want to live on, but there ain’t no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
rich people here. Nobody’s got any black ones—only three or
four; no one’s got fifty or a hundred, like as they have down
in the East.” “It would be better,” interrupted another,
somewhat fiercely, “there warn’t any at all; that’s my mind
about it; they’re no business here; they ought to be in their
own country and take care of themselves, that’s what I
believe, and I don’t care who hears it.” But let the reader
not be deceived by these expressions; they indicate simply
the weakness and cowardice of the class represented by
these men. It is not slavery they detest; it is simply the
negro competition, and the monopoly of the opportunities to
make money by negro owners, which they feel and but dimly
comprehend.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>If you meet a man without stopping, the salutation here
always is, “How d’ye do, sir?” never “Good morning;”
and on parting it is, “I wish you well, sir,” more frequently
than “Good-bye.” You are always commanded to appear at
the table, as elsewhere throughout the South, in a rough,
peremptory tone, as if your host feared you would try to
excuse yourself.</p>

<p>“Come in to supper.” “Take a seat.” “Some of the fry?”
“Help yourself to anything you see that you can eat.”</p>

<p>They ask your name, but do not often call you by it, but
hail you “Stranger,” or “Friend.”</p>

<p>Texas is always spoken of in the plural—“the Texies.”
“Bean’t the Texies powerful sickly?”</p>

<p>“Ill” is used for “vicious.” “Is your horse ill?” “Not
that I am aware of. Does he appear so?” “No; but some
horses will bite a stranger if he goes to handling on ’em.”</p>

<p>“Is your horse ill?” “No, I believe not.” “I see he
kind o’ drapt his ears when I came up, ’zif he was playful.”</p>

<p>Everybody I’ve met in the last three counties—after ascertaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
what parts I came from, and which parts I’m going
to, where I got my horse, what he cost, and of what breed he
is, what breed the dog is, and whether she’s followed me all
the way from the Texies, if her feet ain’t worn out, and if I
don’t think I’ll have to tote her if I go much further, and if I
don’t want to give her away, how I like the Texies, etc.—has
asked me whether I didn’t see a man by the name of Baker in
the Texies, who was sheriff of —— county, and didn’t
behave exactly the gentleman, or another fellow by the name
of ——, who ran away from the same county, and cut to
the Texies. I’ve been asked if they had done fighting yet in
the Texies, referring to the war with Mexico, which was
ended ten years ago. Indeed the ignorance with regard to
everything transpiring in the world outside, and the absurd
ideas and reports I hear, are quite incredible. It cannot be supposed
that having been at home in New York, there should be
any one there whom I do not personally know, or that, having
passed through Texas, I should be unable to speak from personal
knowledge of the welfare of every one in that State.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>North-eastern Tennessee</i>,——.—Night before last I spent
at the residence of a man who had six slaves; last night, at
the home of a farmer without slaves. Both houses were of
the best class common in this region; two-story framed
buildings, large, and with many beds, to accommodate
drovers and waggoners, who, at some seasons, fill the houses
which are known to be prepared with stabling, corn, and beds
for them. The slaveholder was much the wealthier of the
two, and his house originally was the finer, but he lived in
much less comfort than the other. His house was in great
need of repair, and was much disordered; it was dirty, and
the bed given me to sleep in was disgusting. He and his
wife made the signs of pious people, but were very morose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
or sadly silent, when not scolding and re-ordering their
servants. Their son, a boy of twelve, was alternately crying
and bullying his mother all the evening till bed-time, because
his father had refused to give him something that he wanted.
He slept in the same room with me, but did not come to bed
until after I had once been asleep, and then he brought
another boy to sleep with him. He left the candle burning
on the floor, and when, in five minutes after he had got into
bed, a girl came after it, he cursed her with a shocking volubility
of filthy blackguardism, demanding why she had not
come sooner. She replied gently and entreatingly, “I didn’t
think you’d have more ’n got into bed yet, master John.”
The boys were talking and whispering obscenity till I fell
asleep again. The white women of the house were very
negligent and sluttish in their attire; the food at the table
badly cooked, and badly served by negroes.</p>

<p>The house of the farmer without slaves, though not in
good repair, was much neater, and everything within was
well-ordered and unusually comfortable. The women and
girls were clean and neatly dressed; every one was cheerful
and kind. There was no servant. The table was abundantly
supplied with the most wholesome food—I might almost say
the first wholesome food—I have had set before me since I
was at the hotel at Natchez; loaf bread for the first time;
chickens, stewed instead of fried; potatoes without fat; two
sorts of simple preserved fruit, and whortleberry and blackberry
tarts. (The first time I have had any of these articles
at a private house since I was in Western Texas.) All the
work, both within and without the house, was carried on
regularly and easily, and it was well done, because done by
parties interested in the result, not by servants interested
only to escape reproof or punishment.</p>

<p>Doubtless two extreme cases were thus brought together,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
but similar, if less striking, contrasts are found the general
rule, according to my experience. It is a common saying
with the drovers and waggoners of this country, that if you
wish to be well taken care of, you must not stop at houses
where they have slaves.</p>

<p>The man of the last described house was intelligent and an
ardent Methodist. The room in which I slept was papered
with the “Christian Advocate and Journal,” the Methodist
paper of New York.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> At the slaveholder’s house, my bed-room
was partially papered with “Lottery Schemes.”</p>

<p>The free labouring farmer remarked, that, although there
were few slaves in this part of the country, he had often
said to his wife that he would rather be living where there
were none. He thought slavery wrong in itself, and deplorable
in its effects upon the white people. Of all the Methodists
whom he knew in North-eastern Tennessee and South-western
Virginia, he believed that fully three fourths would be glad
to join the Methodist Church North, if it were “convenient.”
They generally thought slavery wrong, and believed it the
duty of the church to favour measures to bring it to an end.
He was not an Abolitionist, he said; he didn’t think slaves
could be set free at once, but they ought to be sent back to
their own country, and while they were here they ought to
be educated. He had perceived that great injustice was done
by the people both of the North and South, towards each
other. At the South, people were very apt to believe that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
the Northerners were wanting not only to deprive them of
their property, but also to incite the slaves to barbarity and
murder. At the North, people thought that the negroes
were all very inhumanely treated. That was not the case, at
least hereabouts, it wasn’t. If I would go with him to a
camp meeting here, or to one of the common Sunday meetings,
I would see that the negroes were generally better dressed
than the whites. He believed that they were always well
fed, and they were not punished severely. They did not
work hard, not nearly as hard as many of the white folks;
they were fat and cheerful. I said that I had perceived this,
and it was so generally, to a great degree, throughout the
country; yet I was sure that on the large plantations it was
necessary to treat the slaves with great severity. He “expected”
it was so, for he had heard people say, who had been
on the great rice and cotton plantations in South Carolina,
that the negroes were treated very hard, and he knew there
was a man down here on the railroad, a contractor, who had
some sixty hands which he had hired in Old Virginny
(“that’s what we call Eastern Virginia here”), and everybody
who saw them at work, said he drove them till they could
hardly stand, and did not give them half what they ought to
have to eat. He was opposed to the Nebraska Bill, he said,
and to any further extension of slavery, on any pretext; the
North would not do its Christian duty if it allowed slavery to
be extended; he wished that it could be abolished in Tennessee.
He thought that many of the people who went
hence to Kansas would vote to exclude slavery, but he wasn’t
sure that they would do it generally, because they would
consider themselves Southerners, and would not like to go
against other Southerners. A large part of the emigration
from this part of the country went to Indiana, Illinois, and
Iowa; those States being preferred to Missouri, because they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
were Free States. There were fewer slaves hereabouts now,
than there were when he was a boy. The people all thought
slavery wrong, except, he supposed, some slaveholders who,
because they had property in slaves, would try to make out
to themselves that it was right. He knew one rich man who
had owned a great many slaves. He thought slavery was
wrong, and he had a family of boys growing up, and he knew
they wouldn’t be good for anything as long as he brought them
up with slaves; so he had told his slaves that if they wanted
to be free, he would free them, send them to Liberia, and
give them a hundred dollars to start with, and they had all
accepted the offer. He himself never owned a slave, and
never would own one for his own benefit, if it were given to
him, “first, because it was wrong; and secondly, because he
didn’t think they ever did a man much good.”</p>

<p>I noticed that the neighbours of this man on each side
owned slaves; and that their houses and establishments were
much poorer than his.</p>

<span class="s08">THE EXCEPTIONAL LARGE PLANTERS.</span></h2>

<p><i>Feliciana.</i><a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>—A deep notch of sadness marks in my memory
the morning of the May day on which I rode out of the
chattering little town of Bayou Sara, and I recollect little of
its immediate suburbs but the sympathetic cloud-shadows
slowly going before me over the hill of St. Francis. At
the top is an old French hamlet.</p>

<p>One from among the gloomy, staring loungers at the door of
the tavern, as I pass, throws himself upon a horse, and overtaking
me, checks his pace to keep by my side. I turn
towards him, and being full of aversion for the companionship
of a stranger, nod, in such a manner as to say, “Your equaility
is acknowledged; go on.” Not a nod; not the slightest deflection
of a single line in the austere countenance; not a
ripple of radiance in the sullen eyes, which wander slowly
over, and, at distinct intervals, examine my horse, my saddle-bags,
my spurs, lariat, gloves, finally my face, with such
stern deliberation that, at last, I should not be sorry if he
would speak. But he does not; does not make the smallest
response to the further turning of my head, which acknowledges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
the reflex interest in my own mind; his eyes rest as
fixedly upon me as if they were a dead man’s. I can, at length,
no longer endure this in silence, so I ask, in a voice attuned
to his apparent humour—</p>

<p>“How far to Woodville?”</p>

<p>The only reply is a slight grunt, with an elevation of the
chin.</p>

<p>“You don’t know?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Never been there.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I can ride there before night, I suppose?”</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>“ood walker, your horse?”</p>

<p>Not a nod.</p>

<p>“I thought mine pretty good.”</p>

<p>Not a sneer, or a gleam of vanity, and Belshazzar and I
warmed up together. Scott’s man of leather occurred to my
mind, and I felt sure that I could guess my man’s chord.
Cotton! I touched it, and in a moment he became animated,
civil; hospitable even. I was immediately informed that this
was a famous cotton region: “when it was first settled up by
’Mericans, used to be reckoned the gardying of the world.
The almightiest rich sile God Almighty ever shuck down.
All on’t owned by big-bugs.” Finally he confided to me that
he was an overseer for one of them, “one of the biggest sort.”
This greatest of the local hemipteras was not now on his
plantation, but had “gone North to Paris or Saratogy, or
some of them places.”</p>

<p>Wearing no waistcoat, the overseer carried a pistol, without
a thought of concealment, in the fob of his trousers.
The distance to Woodville, which, after he had exhausted his
subject of cotton, I tried again to ascertain, he did not know, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
would not attempt to guess. The ignorance of the more brutalized
slaves is often described by saying of them that they
cannot count above twenty. I find many of the whites but
little more intelligent. At all events, it is rarely that you
meet, in the plantation districts, a man, whether white or
black, who can give you any clear information about the roads,
or the distances between places in his own vicinity. While
in or near Bayou Sara and St. Francisville, I asked, at different
times, ten men, black and white, the distance to Woodville
(the next town to the northward on the map). None
answered with any appearance of certainty, and those who
ventured to give an opinion, differed in their estimates as much
as ten miles. I found the actual distance to be, I think, about
twenty-four miles. After riding by my side for a mile or two
the overseer suddenly turned off at a fork in the road, with
hardly more ceremony than he had used in joining me.</p>

<p>For some miles about St. Francisville the landscape has an
open, suburban character, with residences indicative of rapidly
accumulating wealth, and advancement in luxury, or careless
expenditure, among the proprietors. For twenty miles to the
north of the town, there is on both sides a succession of large
sugar and cotton plantations. Much land still remains uncultivated,
however. The roadside fences are generally hedges
of roses—Cherokee and sweet brier. These are planted first
by the side of a common rail fence, which, while they are
young, supports them in the manner of a trellis; as they
grow older they fall each way, and mat together, finally forming
a confused, sprawling, slovenly thicket, often ten feet in
breadth and four to six feet high. Trumpet creepers, grape-vines,
green-briers, and in very rich soil, cane, grow up
through the mat of roses, and add to its strength. It is not
as pretty as a more upright hedge, yet very agreeable, and,
at one or two points, where the road was narrow, deep, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
lane like, delightful memories of England were brought to
mind.</p>

<p>There were frequent groves of magnolia grandiflora, large
trees, and every one in the glory of full blossom. The magnolia
does not, however, mass well, and the road-side woods
were much finer, where the beech, elm, and liquid amber
formed the body, and the magnolias stood out against them,
magnificent chandeliers of fragrance. The large-leaved magnolia,
very beautiful at this season, was more rarely seen.</p>

<p>The soil seems generally rich, though much washed off the
higher ground. The ploughing is directed with some care not
to favour this process. Young pine trees, however, and other
indications of rapid impoverishment, are seen on many plantations.</p>

<p>The soil is a sandy loam, so friable that the negroes always
working in large gangs, superintended by a driver with a
whip, continued their hoeing in the midst of quite smart
showers, and when the road had become a poaching mud.</p>

<p>Only once did I see a gang which had been allowed to discontinue
its work on account of the rain. This was after a
heavy thunder shower, and the appearance of the negroes
whom I met crossing the road in returning to the field, from
the gin-house to which they had retreated, was remarkable.
First came, led by an old driver carrying a whip, forty of the
largest and strongest women I ever saw together; they were
all in a simple uniform dress of a bluish check stuff, the skirts
reaching little below the knee; their legs and feet were
bare; they carried themselves loftily, each having a hoe over
the shoulder, and walking with a free, powerful swing.
Behind them came the cavalry, thirty strong, mostly men,
but a few of them women, two of whom rode astride on the
plough mules. A lean and vigilant white overseer, on a brisk
pony, brought up the rear. The men wore small blue Scotch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
bonnets; many of the women, handkerchiefs, turban fashion,
and a few nothing at all on their heads. They were evidently
a picked lot. I thought that every one would pass for a
“prime” cotton hand.</p>

<p>The slaves generally of this district appear uncommonly
well—doubtless, chiefly, because the large incomes of their
owners enables them to select the best from the yearly exportations
of Virginia and Kentucky, but also because they are
systematically well fed.</p>

<p>The plantation residences were of a cottage class, sometimes,
but not usually, with extensive and tasteful grounds about them.</p>

<p>An old gentleman, sensible, polite, and communicative, who
rode a short distance with me, said that many of the proprietors
were absentees—some of the plantations had dwellings only
for the negroes and the overseer. He called my attention to
a field of cotton which, he said, had been ruined by his overseer’s
neglect. The negroes had been allowed at a critical
time to be careless in their hoeing, and it would now be impossible
to recover the ground then lost. Grass grew so rampantly
in this black soil, that if it once got a good start ahead,
you could never overtake it. That was the devil of a rainy
season. Cotton could stand drouth better than it could grass.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>
<p>The inclosures are not often of less area than a hundred
acres. Fewer than fifty negroes are seldom found on a plantation;
many muster by the hundred. In general the fields
are remarkably free from weeds and well tilled.</p>

<p>I arrived shortly after dusk at Woodville, a well-built and
pleasant court-town, with a small but pretentious hotel.
Court was in session, I fancy, for the house was filled with
guests of somewhat remarkable character. The landlord was
inattentive, and, when followed up, inclined to be uncivil. At
the ordinary—supper and breakfast alike—there were twelve
men beside myself, all of them wearing black cloth coats,
black cravats, and satin or embroidered waistcoats; all, too,
sleek as if just from a hairdresser’s, and redolent of perfumes,
which really had the best of it with the exhalations of the
kitchen. Perhaps it was because I was not in the regulation
dress that I found no one ready to converse with me, and
could obtain not the slightest information about my road, even
from the landlord.</p>

<p>I might have left Woodville with more respect for this decorum
if I had not, when shown by a servant to my room,
found two beds in it, each of which proved to be furnished
with soiled sheets and greasy pillows, nor was it without
reiterated demands and liberal cash in hand to the servant,
that I succeeded in getting them changed on the one I
selected. A gentleman of embroidered waistcoat took the
other bed as it was, with no apparent reluctance, soon after
I had effected my own arrangements. One wash-bowl, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
a towel which had already been used, was expected to
answer for both of us, and would have done so but that I
carried a private towel in my saddle-bags. Another requirement
of a civilized household was wanting, and its only
substitute unavailable with decency.</p>

<p>The bill was excessive, and the black ostler, who had left
the mud of yesterday hanging all along the inside of Belshazzar’s
legs, and who had put the saddle on so awkwardly
that I resaddled him myself after he had brought him to the
door, grumbled, in presence of the landlord, at the smallness
of the gratuity which I saw fit to give him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The country, for some distance north of Woodville, is the
most uneven, for a non-mountainous region, I ever saw.
The road seems well engineered, yet you are nearly all the
time mounting or descending the sides of protuberances or
basins, ribs or dykes. In one place it follows along the top
of a crooked ridge, as steep-sided and regular for nearly a
quarter of a mile, as a high railroad embankment. A man
might jump off anywhere and land thirty feet below. The
ground being too rough here for cultivation, the dense native
forest remains intact.</p>

<p>This ridge, a man told me, had been a famous place for
robberies. It is not far from the Mississippi bottoms.</p>

<p>“Thar couldn’t be,” said he, “a better location for a feller
that wanted to foller that business. There was one chap
there a spell ago, who built himself a cabin t’other side the
river. He used to come over in a dug-out. He could
paddle his dug-out up the swamp, you see, to within two mile
of the ridge; then, when he stopped a man, he’d run
through the woods to his dug-out, and before the man could
get help, he’d be t’other side the Mississippi, a sittin’ in his
housen as honest as you be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>The same man had another story of the ridge:-</p>

<p>“Mr. Allen up here caught a runaway once, and started
to take him down to Woodville to the jail. He put him in
irons and carried him along in his waggin. The nigger was
peaceable and submissive till they got along onto that yer
ridge place. When they got thar, all of a sudden he gin a
whop like, and over he went twenty foot plum down the
side of the ridge. ’Fore Allen could stop his hoss he’d
tumbled and rolled himself ’way out of sight. He started right
away arter him, but he never cotched a sight on him again.”</p>

<p>Not far north of the ridge, plantations are found again,
though the character of the surface changes but little. The
hill-sides are carefully ploughed so that each furrow forms a
contour line. After the first ploughing the same lines are
followed in subsequent cultivation, year in and year out, as
long as enough soil remains to grow cotton upon with profit.
On the hills recently brought into cultivation, broad, serpentine
ditches, having a fall of from two to four inches in a rod,
have been frequently constructed: these are intended to prevent
the formation of gullies leading more directly down the
hill during heavy rains. But all these precautions are not
fully successful, the cultivated hills, in spite of them, losing
soil every year in a melancholy manner.</p>

<p>I passed during the day four or five large plantations, the
hill-sides worn, cleft, and channelled like icebergs; stables and
negro quarters all abandoned, and everything given up to
nature and decay.</p>

<p>In its natural state the virgin soil appears the richest I
have ever seen, the growth upon it from weeds to trees being
invariably rank and rich in colour. At first it is expected to
bear a bale and a half of cotton to the acre, making eight or
ten bales for each able field-hand. But from the cause described
its productiveness rapidly decreases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>Originally, much of this country was covered by a natural
growth of cane, and by various nutritious grasses. A good
northern farmer would deem it a crying shame and sin to
attempt to grow any crops upon such steep slopes, except
grasses or shrubs which do not require tillage. The waste of
soil which attends the practice is much greater than it would
be at the North, and, notwithstanding the unappeasable
demand of the world for cotton, its bad economy, considering
the subject nationally, cannot be doubted.</p>

<p>If these slopes were thrown into permanent terraces, with
turfed or stone-faced escarpments, the fertility of the soil
might be preserved, even with constant tillage. In this way
the hills would continue for ages to produce annual crops of
greater value than those which are at present obtained from
them at such destructive expense—from ten to twenty crops
of cotton rendering them absolute deserts. But with negroes
at fourteen hundred dollars a head, and fresh land in Texas at
half a dollar an acre, nothing of this sort can be thought of.
The time will probably come when the soil now washing into
the adjoining swamps will be brought back by our descendants,
perhaps on their heads, in pots and baskets, in the
manner Huc describes in China,—and which may be seen
also in the Rhenish vineyards,—to be relaid on these sunny
slopes, to grow the luxurious cotton in.</p>

<p>The plantations are all large, but, except in their size and
rather unusually good tillage, display few signs of wealthy
proprietorship. The greater number have but small and
mean residences upon them. No poor white people live upon
the road, nor in all this country of rich soils are they seen,
except <i>en voyage</i>. In a distance of seventy-five miles I saw
no houses without negro-cabins attached, and I calculated
that there were fifty slaves, on an average, to every white
family resident in the country under my view. (There is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
small sandy region about Woodville, which I passed through
after nightfall, and which, of course, my note does not
include.)</p>

<p>I called in the afternoon, at a house, almost the only one
I had seen during the day which did not appear to be the
residence of a planter or overseer, to obtain lodging. No one
was at home but a negro woman and children. The woman
said that her master never took in strangers; there was a
man a few miles further on who did; it was the only place
she knew at which I was likely to “get in.”</p>

<p>I found the place: probably the proprietor was the poorest
white man whose house I had passed during the day, but he
had several slaves; one of them, at least, a very superior man,
worth fully $2,000.</p>

<p>Just before me, another traveller, a Mr. S., from beyond
Natchez, had arrived. Learning that I was from Texas, he
immediately addressed me with volubility.</p>

<p>“Ah! then you can tell us something about it, and I would
be obliged to you if you would. Been out west about
Antonio? Ranchering’s a good business, eh, out west there?
Isn’t it? Make thirty per cent. by it, eh? I hear so.
Should think that would be a good business. How much
capital ought a man to have to go into ranchering, good, eh?
So as to make it a good business?”</p>

<p>He was a middle-aged, well-dressed man, devouring tobacco
prodigiously; nervous and wavering in his manner; asking
questions, a dozen at a breath, and paying no heed to the
answers. He owned a plantation in the bottoms, and another
on the upland; the latter was getting worn out, it was too
unhealthy for him to live in the bottoms, and so, as he said,
he had had “a good notion to go into ranchering. Just for
ease and pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Fact is, though, I’ve got a family, and this is no country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
for children to be raised in. All the children get such
foolish notions. I don’t want my children to be brought up
here. Ruins everybody. Does sir, sure. Spoils ’em. Too
bad. ’Tis so. Too bad. Can’t make anything of children
here, sir. Can’t sir. Fact.”</p>

<p>He had been nearly persuaded to purchase a large tract of
land at a point upon a certain creek where, he had been told,
was a large court-house, an excellent school, etc. The waters
of the creek he named are brackish, the neighbouring
country is a desert, and the only inhabitants, savages. Some
knavish speculator had nearly got a customer, but could not
quite prevail on him to purchase until he examined the
country personally, which it was his intention soon to do. He
gave me no time to tell him how false was the account he
had had, but went on, after describing its beauties and advantages—</p>

<p>“But negro property isn’t very secure there, I’m told.
How is’t? Know?”</p>

<p>“Not at all secure, sir; if it is disposed to go, it will go:
the only way you could keep it would be to make it always
contented to remain. The road would always be open to
Mexico; it would go when it liked.”</p>

<p>“So I hear. Only way is, to have young ones there and
keep their mothers here, eh? Negroes have such attachments,
you know. Don’t you think that would fix ’em, eh?
No? No, I suppose not. If they got mad at anything,
they’d forget their mothers, eh? Yes, I suppose they would.
Can’t depend on niggers. But I reckon they’d come back.
Only to be worse off in Mexico—eh?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but——”</p>

<p>“Being free, eh? Get tired of that, I should think.
Nobody to take care of them. No, I suppose not. Learn to
take care of themselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>Then he turned to our host and began to ask him about his
neighbours, many of whom he had known when he was a boy,
and been at school with. A sorry account he got of most.
Generally they had run through their property; their lands
had passed into new hands; their negroes had been disposed
of; two were now, he thought, “strikers” for gamblers in
Natchez.</p>

<p>“What is a striker?” I asked the landlord at the first
opportunity.</p>

<p>“Oh! to rope in fat fellows for the gamblers; they don’t
do that themselves, but get somebody else. I don’t know as
it is so; all I know is, they don’t have no business, not till
late at night; they never stir out till late at night, and nobody
knows how they live, and that’s what I expect they do.
Fellows that come into town flush, you know—sold out their
cotton and are flush—they always think they must see everything,
and try their hands at everything—they get hold of
’em and bring ’em in to the gamblers, and get ’em tight for
’em, you know.”</p>

<p>“How’s —— got along since his father died?” asked
Mr. S.</p>

<p>“Well, ——’s been unfortunate. Got mad with his overseer;
thought he was lazy and packed him off; then he
undertook to oversee for himself, and he was unfortunate.
Had two bad crops. Finally the sheriff took about half his
niggers. He tried to work the plantation with the rest, but
they was old, used-up hands, and he got mad that they would
not work more, and tired o’ seein’ ’em, and ’fore the end of
the year he sold ’em all.”</p>

<p>Another young man, whom he inquired about, had had his
property managed for him by a relative till he came of age,
and had been sent North to college. When he returned and
got into his own hands, the first year he ran it in debt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
$16,000. The income from it being greatly reduced under
his management, he had put it back in the care of his relative,
but continued to live upon it. “I see,” continued our host,
“every time any of their teams pass from town they fetch a
barrel or a demijohn. There is a parcel of fellows, who,
when they can’t liquor anywhere else, always go to him.”</p>

<p>“But how did he manage to spend so much,” I inquired,
“the first year after his return, as you said,—in gambling?”</p>

<p>“Well, he gambled some, and run horses. He don’t know
anything about a horse, and, of course, he thinks he knows
everything. Those fellows up at Natchez would sell him
any kind of a tacky for four or five hundred dollars, and then
after he’d had him a month, they’d ride out another and
make a bet of five or six hundred dollars they’d beat him.
Then he’d run with ’em, and of course he’d lose it.”</p>

<p>“But sixteen thousand dollars is a large sum of money to
be worked off even in that way in a year,” I observed.</p>

<p>“Oh, he had plenty of other ways. He’d go into a bar-room,
and get tight and commence to break things. They’d
let him go on, and the next morning hand him a bill for a
hundred dollars. He thinks that’s a smart thing, and just
laughs and pays it, and then treats all around again.”</p>

<p>By one and the other, many stories were then told of similar
follies of young men. Among the rest, this:—</p>

<p>A certain man had, as was said to be the custom when
running for office, given an order at a grocery for all to be
“treated” who applied in his name. The grocer, after the
election, which resulted in the defeat of the treater, presented
what was thought an exorbitant bill. He refused to pay it,
and a lawsuit ensued. A gentleman in the witness box being
asked if he thought it possible for the whole number of
people taking part in the election to have consumed the
quantity of liquor alleged, answered—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>“Moy Goad! Judge!” (reproachfully): “Yes, sir! Why,
I’ve been charged for a hundred and fifty drinks <i>’fore breakfast</i>,
when I’ve stood treat, and I never thought ’o disputin’
it.”</p>

<p>At supper, Mr. S., looking at the daughter of our host,
said—</p>

<p>“What a pretty girl that is. My dear, do you find any
schools to go to, out here—eh? I reckon not. This isn’t the
country for schools. There’ll not be a school in Mississippi
’fore long, I reckon. Nothing but Institutes, eh? Ha! ha!
ha! Institutes, humph! Don’t believe there’s a school
between this and Natchez, is there?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Of course there isn’t.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>“What sort of a country is it, then, between here and
Natchez?” I asked. “I should suppose it would be well
settled.”</p>

<p>“Big plantations, sir. Nothing else. Aristocrats. Swell-heads,
I call them, sir. Nothing but swell-heads, and you
can’t get a night’s lodging, sir. Beyond the ferry, I’ll be
bound, a man might die on the road ’fore he’d get a lodging
with one of them. Eh, Mr. N.? So, isn’t it? ‘Take a
stranger in, and I’ll clear you out!’ That’s the rule. That’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
what they tell their overseers, eh? Yes, sir; just so inhospitable
as that. Swell-heads! Swell-heads, sir. Every
plantation. Can’t get a meal of victuals or a night’s lodging
from one of them, I don’t suppose, not if your life depended
on it. Can you, Mr. N.?”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe Mr. ——, his place is right on the road,
and it’s half way to the ferry, and I believe he tells his overseer
if a man comes and wants something to eat, he must
give it to him, but he must not take any pay for it, because
strangers must have something to eat. They start out of
Natchez, thinking it’s as ’tis in other countries; that there’s
houses along, where they can get a meal, and so they don’t
provide for themselves, and when they get along about there,
they are sometimes desperate hungry. Had to be something
done.”</p>

<p>“Do the planters not live themselves on their plantations?”</p>

<p>“Why, a good many of them has two or three plantations,
but they don’t often live on any of them.”</p>

<p>“Must have ice for their wine, you see,” said Mr. S., “or
they’d die. So they have to live in Natchez or New Orleans.
A heap of them live in New Orleans.”</p>

<p>“And in summer they go up into Kentucky, do they not?
I’ve seen country houses there which were said to belong to
cotton-planters from Mississippi.”</p>

<p>“No, sir. They go North. To New York, and Newport,
and Saratoga, and Cape May, and Seneca Lake. Somewhere
that they can display themselves more than they do here.
Kentucky is no place for that. That’s the sort of people, sir,
all the way from here to Natchez. And all round Natchez,
too. And in all this section of country where there’s good
land. Good God! I wouldn’t have my children educated, sir,
among them, not to have them as rich as Dr. ——, every one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
of them. You can know their children as far off as you can
see them. Young swell-heads! You’ll take note of ’em in
Natchez. You can tell them by their walk. I noticed it
yesterday at the Mansion House. They sort o’ throw out
their legs as if they hadn’t got strength enough to lift ’em and
put them down in any particular place. They do want so
bad to look as if they weren’t made of the same clay as the
rest of God’s creation.”</p>

<p>Some allowance is of course to be made for the splenetic
temperament of this gentleman, but facts evidently afford
some justification of his sarcasms. This is easily accounted
for. The farce of the vulgar-rich has its foundation in
Mississippi, as in New York and in Manchester, in the rapidity
with which certain values have advanced, especially that of
cotton, and, simultaneously, that of cotton lands and negroes.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Of course, there are men of refinement and cultivation among
the rich planters of Mississippi, and many highly estimable
and intelligent persons outside of the wealthy class, but the
number of such is smaller in proportion to that of the immoral,
vulgar, and ignorant newly-rich, than in any other
part of the United States. And herein is a radical difference
between the social condition of this region and that of the
sea-board slave States, where there are fewer wealthy families,
but where among the few people of wealth, refinement and
education are more general.</p>

<p>I asked how rich the sort of men were of whom he spoke.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>
<p>“Why, sir, from a hundred thousand to ten million.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that between here and Natchez there are
none worth less than a hundred thousand dollars?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not beyond the ferry. Why, any sort of a plantation
is worth a hundred thousand dollars. The niggers
would sell for that.”</p>

<p>“How many negroes are there on these plantations?”</p>

<p>“From fifty to a hundred.”</p>

<p>“Never over one hundred?”</p>

<p>“No; when they’ve increased to a hundred they always
divide them; stock another plantation. There are sometimes
three or four plantations adjoining one another, with an
overseer for each, belonging to the same man. But that
isn’t general. In general, they have to strike off for new
land.”</p>

<p>“How many acres will a hand tend here?”</p>

<p>“About fifteen—ten of cotton, and five of corn; some pretend
to make them tend twenty.”</p>

<p>“And what is the usual crop?”</p>

<p>“A bale and a half to the acre on fresh land and in the
bottom. From four to eight bales to a hand they generally
get: sometimes ten and better, when they are lucky.”</p>

<p>“A bale and a half on fresh land? How much on old?”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t tell. Depends on how much it’s worn
and what the season is so much. Old land, after a while,
isn’t worth bothering with.”</p>

<p>“Do most of these large planters who live so freely, anticipate
their crops as the sugar planters are said to—spend the
money, I mean, before the crop is sold?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, and three and four crops ahead generally.”</p>

<p>“Are most of them the sons of rich men? are they old
estates?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; lots of them were overseers once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>“Have you noticed whether it is a fact that these
large properties seldom continue long in the same family?
Do the grandsons of wealthy planters often become poor
men?”</p>

<p>“Generally the sons do. Almost always their sons are
fools, and soon go through with it.”</p>

<p>“If they don’t kill themselves before their fathers die,”
said the other.</p>

<p>“Yes. They drink hard and gamble, and of course that
brings them into fights.”</p>

<p>This was while they were smoking on the gallery after
supper. I walked to the stable to see how my horse was
provided for, and took my notes of the conversation. When
I returned they were talking of negroes who had died of
yellow fever while confined in the jail at Natchez. Two of
them were spoken of as having been thus “happily released,”
being under sentence of death, and unjustly so, in their
opinion.</p>

<p>A man living in this vicinity having taken a runaway while
the fever was raging in the jail at Natchez, a physician advised
him not to send him there. He did not, and the negro
escaped; was some time afterward recaptured, and the owner
having learned from him that he had been once before taken
and not detained according to law, he made a journey to inquire
into the matter, and was very angry. He said, “Whenever
you catch a nigger again, you send him to jail, no matter
what’s to be feared. If he dies in the jail, you are not responsible.
You’ve done your duty, and you can leave the
rest to Providence.”</p>

<p>“That was right, too,” said Mr. P. “Yes, he ought to a’
minded the law. Then if he’d died in jail, he’d know ’twasn’t
his fault.”</p>

<p>Next morning, near the ferry house, I noticed a set of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
stocks, having holes for the head as well as the ankles; they
stood unsheltered and unshaded in the open road.</p>

<p>I asked an old negro what it was.</p>

<p>“Dat ting, massa?” grinning; “well, sah, we calls dat a
ting to put black people, niggers, in, when dey misbehaves bad,
and to put runaways in, sah. Heaps o’ runaways, dis country,
sah. Yes, sah, heaps on ’em round here.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Mr. S. and I slept in the same room. I went to bed some
time before him; he sat up late, to smoke, he said. He woke
me when he came in, by his efforts to barricade the door with
our rather limited furniture. The room being small, and
without a window, I expostulated. He acknowledged it would
probably make us rather too warm, but he shouldn’t feel safe
if the door were left open. “You don’t know,” said he;
“there may be runaways around.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>
<p>He then drew two small revolvers, hitherto concealed under
his clothing, and began to examine the caps. He was certainly
a nervous man, perhaps a madman. I suppose he saw
some expression of this thought in my face, for he said,
placing them so they could be easily taken up as he lay in
bed, “Sometimes a man has a use for them when he least
expects it. There was a gentleman on this road a few days
ago. He was going to Natchez. He overtook a runaway,
and he says to him, ‘Bad company’s better’n none, boy, and
I reckon I’ll keep you along with me into Natchez.’ The
nigger appeared to be pleased to have company, and went
along, talking with him, very well, till they came to a thicket
place, about six miles from Natchez. Then he told him he
reckoned he would not go any further with him. ‘What!
you black rascal,’ says he; ‘you mean you won’t go in with
me? You step out and go straight ahead, and if you turn
your face till you get into Natchez, I’ll shoot you.’ ‘Aha!
massa,’ says the nigger, mighty good-natured, ‘I reckon you
’aint got no shootin’ irons;’ and he bolted off into the thicket,
and got away from him.”</p>

<p>At breakfast, Mr. S. came late. He bowed his head as he
took his seat, and closed his eyes for a second or two; then,
withdrawing his quid of tobacco and throwing it in the fireplace,
he looked round with a smile, and said:—</p>

<p>“I always think it a good plan to thank the Lord for His
mercies. I’m afraid some people’ll think I’m a member of the
church. I aint, and never was. Wish I was. I am a Son,
though [of Temperance?] Give me some water, girl. Coffee
first. Never too soon for coffee. And never too late, I say.
Wait for anything but coffee. These swell-heads drink their
coffee after they’ve eaten all their dinner. I want it with
dinner, eh? Don’t nothing taste good without coffee, I
reckon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>Before he left, he invited me to visit his plantations, giving
me careful directions to find them, and saying that if he
should not have returned before I reached them, his wife and
his overseer would give me every attention if I would tell
them he told me to visit them. He said again, and in this
connection, that he believed this was the most inhospitable
country in the world, and asked, “as I had been a good deal
of a traveller, didn’t I think so myself?” I answered that
my experience was much too small to permit me to form an
opinion so contrary to that generally held.</p>

<p>If they had a reputation for hospitality, he said, it could
only be among their own sort. They made great swell-head
parties; and when they were on their plantation places, they
made it a point to have a great deal of company; they would
not have anything to do if they didn’t. But they were all
swell-heads, I might be sure; they’d never ask anybody but
a regular swell-head to see them.</p>

<p>His own family, however, seemed not to be excluded from
the swell-head society.</p>

<p>Among numerous anecdotes illustrative of the folly of his
neighbours, or his own prejudices and jealousy, I remember
none which it would be proper to publish but the following:-</p>

<p>“Do you remember a place you passed?” [describing the
locality].</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I; “a pretty cottage with a large garden,
with some statues or vases in it.”</p>

<p>“I think it likely. Got a foreign gardener, I expect.
That’s all the fashion with them. A nigger isn’t good enough
for them. Well, that belongs to Mr. A. J. Clayborn.[?]
He’s got to be a very rich man. I suppose he’s got as many
as five hundred people on all his places. He went out to
Europe a few years ago, and sometime after he came back, he
came up to Natchez. I was there with my wife at the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
time, and as she and Mrs. Clayborn came from the same
section of country, and used to know each other when they
were girls, she thought she must go and see her. Mrs.
Clayborn could not talk about anything but the great people
they had seen in Europe. She was telling of some great
nobleman’s castle they went to, and the splendid park there
was to it, and how grandly they lived. For her part, she
admired it so much, and they made so many friends among
the people of quality, she said, she didn’t care if they always
stayed there. In fact, she really wanted Mr. Clayborn to buy
one of the castles, and be a nobleman himself. ‘But he
wouldn’t,’ says she; ‘he’s such a strong Democrat, you
know.’ Ha! ha! ha! I wonder what old Tom Jeff. would
have said to these swell-head Democrats.”</p>

<p>I asked him if there were no poor people in this country.
I could see no houses which seemed to belong to poor people.</p>

<p>“Of course not, sir. Every inch of the land bought up by
the swell-heads on purpose to keep them away. But you go
back on to the pine ridge. Good Lord! I’ve heard a heap
about the poor folks at the North; but if you ever saw any
poorer people than them, I should like to know what they
live on. Must be a miracle if they live at all. I don’t see
how these people live, and I’ve wondered how they do a
great many times. Don’t raise corn enough, great many of
them, to keep a shoat alive through the winter. There’s no
way they can live, ’less they steal.”</p>

<p>At the ferry of the Homochitto I fell in with a German,
originally from Dusseldorf, whence he came seventeen years
ago, first to New York; afterward he had resided successively
in Baltimore, Cincinnati, New Orleans, Pensacola, Mobile,
and Natchez. By the time he reached the last place he had
lost all his money. Going to work as a labourer in the town,
he soon earned enough again to set him up as a trinket peddler;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
and a few months afterward he was able to buy “a leetle
coach-dray.” Then, he said, he made money fast; for he
would go back into the country, among the poor people, and
sell them trinkets, and calico, and handkerchiefs, and patent
medicines. They never had any money. “All poor folks,”
he said; “dam poor; got no money; oh no; but I say, ’dat
too bad, I don’t like to balk you, my frind; may be so, you
got some egg, some fedder, some cheeken, some rag, some
sass, or some skin vot you kill.’ I takes dem dings vot they’s
got, and ven I gets my load I cums to Natchez back and sells
dem, alvays dwo or dree times so much as dey coss me; and
den I buys some more goots. Not bad beesnes—no. Oh,
dese poor people dey deenk me is von fool ven I buy some
dime deir rag vat dey bin vear; dey calls me de ole Dutch
cuss. But dey don’t know nottin’ vot it is vorth. I deenk
dey neever see no money; may be so dey geev all de cheeken
vot they been got for a leetle breaspin vot cost me not so much
as von beet. Sometime dey be dam crazy fool; dey know
not how do make de count at all. Yees, I makes some money,
a heap.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>From the Homochitto to the suburbs of Natchez, a good
half-day’s ride, I found the country beautiful; fewer hills
than before, the soil very rich, and the land almost all inclosed
in plantations, the roadside boundaries of which are old rose-hedges.
The road is well constructed, and often, in passing
through the hills, with high banks on each side, coped with
thick and dark, but free and sportive hedges, out of which
grow bending trees, brooding angle-like over the traveller, the
sentiment of the most charming Herefordshire lanes is reproduced.
There are also frequent oak-woods, the trees often of
great height. Sometimes these have been inclosed with neat
palings, and slightly and tastefully thinned out, so as to form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
noble grounds around the residences of the planters, which
are always very simple and unostentatious wooden houses.
Near two of these are unusually good ranges of negro-houses.
On many of the plantations, perhaps most, no residence is
visible from the road, and the negro quarters, when seen, are
the usual comfortless log-huts.</p>

<p>Within three miles of the town the country is entirely
occupied by houses and grounds of a villa character; the
grounds usually paltry with miniature terraces, and trees and
shrubs planted and trimmed with no regard to architectural
or landscape considerations. There is, however, an abundance
of good trees, much beautiful shrubbery, and the best hedges
and screens of evergreen shrubs that I have seen in America.
The houses are cheap and shabby.</p>

<p>I was amused to recognize specimens of the “swell-head”
fraternity, described by my nervous friend, as soon as I got
into the villa district. First came two boys in a skeleton
waggon, pitching along with a racking pony, which ran over
Jude; she yelped, I wheeled round, and they pulled up and
looked apologetic. She was only slightly hurt, but thereafter
gave a quicker and broader sheer to approaching vehicles than
her Texas experience had taught her to do.</p>

<p>Then came four youthful riders, and two old, roué-looking
men, all upon a match-trot; the young fellows screaming,
breaking up, and swearing. After them cantered a mulatto
groom, white-gloved and neatly dressed, who, I noticed,
bowed politely, lifting his hat and smiling to a very aged and
ragged negro with a wheelbarrow and shovel, on the foot path.</p>

<p>Next came—and it was a swelteringly hot afternoon—an
open carriage with two ladies taking an airing. Mr. S. had
said that the swell-heads had “got to think that their old
maumy niggers were not good enough for their young ones;”
and here, on the front seat of the carriage, was a white and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
veritable French bonne, holding a richly-belaced baby. The
ladies sat back, good-looking women enough, prettily dressed,
and excessively demure. But the dignity of the turn-out
chiefly reposed in the coachman, an obese old black man,
who had, by some means, been set high up in the sun’s
face, on the bed-like cushion of the box, to display a great
livery top-coat, with the wonted capes and velvet, buttoned
brightly and tightly to the chin, and crowned by the proper
emblazoned narrow-brimmed hat; his elbows squared, the
reins and whip in his hands, the sweat in globules all over
his ruefully-decorous face, and his eyes fast closed in sleep.</p>

<p>The houses and shops within the town itself are generally
small, and always inelegant. A majority of the names on
the signs are German; the hotel is unusually clean, and the
servants attentive; and the stable at which I left Belshazzar
is excellent, and contains several fine horses. Indeed, I never
saw such a large number of fine horses as there is here, in
any other town of the size. At the stable and the hotel
there is a remarkable number of young men, extraordinarily
dressed, like shop-boys on a Sunday excursion, all lounging
or sauntering, and often calling at the bar; all smoking, all
twisting lithe walking-sticks, all “talking horse.”</p>

<p>But the grand feature of Natchez is the bluff, terminating
in an abrupt precipitous bank over the river, with the public
garden upon it. Of this I never had heard; and when, after
seeing my horse dried off and eating his oats with great
satisfaction—the first time he has ever tasted oats, I suppose,
and I had not seen them before for many months—I strolled
off to see the town, I came upon it by surprise. I entered a
gate and walked up a slope, supposing that I was approaching
the ridge or summit of a hill, and expecting to see beyond
it a corresponding slope and the town again, continuing in
terraced streets to the river. I suddenly found myself on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
the very edge of a great cliff, and before me an indescribably
vast expanse of forest, extending on every hand to a hazy
horizon, in which, directly in front of me, swung the round,
red, setting sun. Through the otherwise unbroken forest,
the Father of Waters had opened a passage for himself,
forming a perfect arc, the hither shore of the middle of the
curve being hidden under the crest of the cliff, and the two
ends lost in the vast obscurity of the Great West. Overlooked
from such an eminence, the size of the Mississippi
can be realized—which is difficult under ordinary circumstances;
but though the fret of a swelling torrent is not
wanting, it is perceptible only as the most delicate chasing
upon the broad, gleaming expanse of polished steel, which at
once shamed all my previous conceptions of the appearance
of the greatest of rivers.</p>

<p>Coming closer to the edge and looking downward, you see
the lower town, of Natchez, its roofs with water flowing all
around them, and its pigmy people wading, and labouring to
carry upward their goods and furniture, in danger from a
rising movement of the great water. Poor people, “emigrants
and niggers” only.</p>

<p>I laid down, and would have reposed my mind in the
infinite vision westward, but was presently disturbed by a hog
which came grunting near me, rooting in the poor turf of
this wonderful garden. I rose and walked its length. Little
more has been done than to inclose a space along the edge,
which it would have been dangerous to build upon, to cut
out some curving alleys now recaptured by the grass and
weeds, and to plant a few succulent trees. A road to the
lower town, cutting through it, is crossed by slight wooden
foot-bridges, and there are some rough plank benches, adorned
with stencilled “medical” advertisements. Some shrubs are
planted on the crumbling face of the cliff, so near the top<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
that the swine can obtain access to them. A man, bearded
and smoking, and a woman with him, sitting at the extreme
end, were the only visitors except myself and the swine.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As I am writing there is a bustle in the street. A young
man is being lifted up and carried into the bar-room. He
is insensible. A beautiful mare, from which he has evidently
been thrown, is led back from around the corner, quivering
with excitement.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I could find no reading-room; no recent newspapers except
<i>The Natchez Free Trader</i>, which has nothing but cotton and
river news and steamboat puffs; no magazines but aged
Harpers; and no recent publications of any sort are for
sale or to be seen at the booksellers’; so, after supper, I
went to the bluff again, and found it most solemnly beautiful;
the young moon shining through rents in the clouds:
the great gleaming crescent of water; the dim, ungapped
horizon; the earth sensibly a mere swinging globe.</p>

<p>Of all the town, only five Germans, sitting together, but
smoking in silence, had gathered for this evening worship.</p>

<p>As I returned up the main street, I stopped opposite a
house from which there came the sound of excellent music—a
violin and piano. I had heard no music since I was in
Western Texas, and I leaned upon a lamp-post for an hour,
listening. Many stopped near me for a few minutes, and
went on. At length, a man who had remained some time,
addressed me, speaking in a foreign tongue. “Can’t you
speak English?” said I.</p>

<p>“You are not an American?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I should tzink it not.”</p>

<p>“I am; I am a New Yorker.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>“So?—O yes, perhaps, but not zis country.”</p>

<p>“What are you?”</p>

<p>“Italian.”</p>

<p>“Do you live here?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Are there many Italians in Natchez?”</p>

<p>“Yes—some many—seven. All big dam rascaal. Yes.
Ha! ha! ha! True. Dam rascaal all of us.”</p>

<p>“What do you do for a living here?”</p>

<p>“For me it is a cigar-store; fruit; confectionary.”</p>

<p>“And the rest?”</p>

<p>“Oh, everytzing. I don’t expect dem be here so much
long now.”</p>

<p>“Why—what will they do?”</p>

<p>“Dey all go to Cuba. Be vawr zair soon now. All go.
All dam rascaal go, can go, ven ze vawr is. Good ting dat
for Natchez, eh? Yes, I tzink.”</p>

<p>He told me the names of the players; the violinist, an
Italian, he asserted to be the best in America. He resided
in Natchez, I understood, as a teacher; and, I presume, the
town has metropolitan advantages for instruction in all
fashionable accomplishments. Yet, with a population of
18,601, the number of children registered for the public
schools and academies, or “Institutes,” of the county seat,
is but 1,015; and among these must be included many sent
from other parts of the State, and from Arkansas and
Louisiana; the public libraries contain but 2,000 volumes,
and the churches seat but 7,700.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Franklin, the next county in the rear of the county in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
which Natchez is situated (Adams), has a population of
6,000, and but 132 children attending school.</p>

<p>Mr. Russell (<i>North America: its Agriculture and Climate</i>,
page 258) states that he had been led to believe that
“as refined society was to be found at Natchez as in any
other part of the United States;” but <i>his personal observation</i>
is, that “the chief frequenters of the best hotel are low,
drunken fellows.” I find a crowd of big, silly boys, not
drunk, but drinking, smoking, chewing, and betting, and a
few men who look like dissolute fourth-rate comedians, who
have succeeded in swindling a swell-mob tailor.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The first night after leaving Natchez I found lodging with
a German, who, when I inquired if he could accommodate
me, at once said, “Yes, sir, I make it <i>a business</i> to lodge
travellers.”</p>

<p>He had a little farm, and owned four strong negro men
and a woman with several children. All his men, however,
he hired out as porters or servants in Natchez, employing a
white man, a native of the country, to work with him on his
farm.</p>

<p>To explain the economy of this arrangement, he said that
one of his men earned in Natchez $30 a month clear of all
expenses, and the others much more than he could ever make
their labour worth to him. A negro of moderate intelligence
would hire, as a house-servant, for $200 a year and his
board, which was worth $8 a month; whereas he hired this
white fellow, who was strong and able, for $10 a month;
and he believed he got as much work out of him as he could
out of a negro. If labour were worth so much as he got for
that of his negroes, why did the white man not demand
more? Well—he kept him in whisky and tobacco beside
his wages, and he was content. Most folks here did not like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
white labourers. They had only been used to have niggers
do their work, and they did not know how to manage with
white labourers; but he had no difficulty.</p>

<p>I asked if eight dollars would cover the cost of a man’s
board? He supposed it might cost him rather more than
that to keep the white man; eight dollars was what it was
generally reckoned in town to cost to keep a negro; niggers
living in town or near it were expected to have “extras;”
out on the plantations, where they did not get anything but
bacon and meal, of course it did not cost so much. Did he
know what it cost to keep a negro generally upon the plantations?
It was generally reckoned, he said, that a nigger
ought to have a peck of meal and three pounds of bacon a
week; some didn’t give so much meat, but he thought it
would be better to give them more.</p>

<p>“You are getting rich,” I said. “Are the Germans
generally, hereabouts, doing well? I see there are a good
many in Natchez.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes; anybody who is not too proud to work can get
rich here.”</p>

<p>The next day, having ridden thirty tedious miles through
a sombre country, with a few large plantations, about six
o’clock I called at the first house standing upon or near the
road which I have seen for some time, and solicited a lodging.
It was refused, by a woman. How far was it to the next
house? I asked her. Two miles and a half. So I found it
to be, but it was a deserted house, falling to decay, on an
abandoned plantation. I rode several miles further, and it
was growing dark, and threatening rain, before I came in
sight of another. It was a short distance off the road, and
approached by a private lane, from which it was separated by
a grass plat. A well dressed man stood between the gate
and the house. I stopped and bowed to him, but he turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
his back upon me and walked to the house. I opened a gate
and rode in. Two men were upon the gallery, but as they
paid no attention to my presence when I stopped near them,
I doubted if either were the master of the house. I asked,
“Could I obtain a lodging here to-night, gentlemen?” One
of them answered, surlily, “No.” I paused a moment that
they might observe me—evidently a stranger benighted, with
a fatigued horse, and then asked, “Can you tell me, sir, how
far it is to a public-house?” “I don’t know,” replied the
same man. I again remained silent a moment. “No
public-houses in this section of the country, I reckon, sir,”
said the other. “Do you know how far it is to the next
house on the road, north of this?” “No,” answered one.
“You’ll find one about two miles, or two miles and a half
from here,” said the other. “Is it a house in which I shall
be likely to get a lodging, do you know?” “I don’t know,
I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Good night, gentlemen; you’ll excuse me for troubling
you. I am entirely a stranger in this region.”</p>

<p>A grunt, or inarticulate monosyllable, from one of them,
was the only reply, and I rode away, glad that I had not
been fated to spend an evening in such company.</p>

<p>Soon afterward I came to a house and stables close upon
the road. There was a man on the gallery playing the
fiddle. I asked, “Could you accommodate me here to-night,
sir?” He stopped fiddling, and turned his head toward
an open door, asking, “Wants to know if you can
accommodate him?” “Accommodate him with what?”
demanded a harsh-toned woman’s voice. “With a bed of
course—what do you s’pose—ho! ho! ho!” and he went on
fiddling again. I had, during this conversation, observed
ranges of negro huts behind the stables, and perceived that
it must be the overseer’s house of the plantation at which I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
had previously called. “Like master, like man,” I thought,
and rode on, my inquiry not having been even answered.</p>

<p>I met a negro boy on the road, who told me it was about
two miles to the next house, but he did not reckon that I
would get in there. “How far to the next house beyond
that?” “About four miles, sir, and I reckon you can get
in there, master; I’ve heerd they did take in travellers to
that place.”</p>

<p>Soon after this it began to rain and grow dark; so dark
that I could not keep the road, for soon finding Belshazzar
in difficulty, I got off and discovered that we were following
up the dry bed of a small stream. In trying to get back I
probably crossed the road, as I did not find it again, and
wandered cautiously among trees for nearly an hour, at
length coming to open country and a fence. Keeping this
in sight, I rode on until I found a gate, entering at which,
I followed a nearly straight and tolerable good road full an
hour, as it seemed to me, at last coming to a large negro
“settlement.”</p>

<p>I passed through it to the end of the rows, where was a
cabin larger than the rest, facing on the space between the
two lines of huts. A shout brought out the overseer. I
begged for a night’s lodging; he was silent; I said that I
had travelled far, was much fatigued and hungry; my horse
was nearly knocked up, and I was a stranger in the country;
I had lost my road, and only by good fortune had found my
way here. At length, as I continued urging my need, he
said—</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you must stop. Ho, Byron! Here,
Byron, take this man’s horse, and put him in <i>my</i> stable.
’Light, sir, and come in.”</p>

<p>Within I found his wife, a young woman, showily dressed—a
caricature of the fashions of the day. Apparently, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
had both been making a visit to neighbours, and but just
come home. I was not received kindly, but at the request of
her husband she brought out and set before me some cold
corn-bread and fat bacon.</p>

<p>Before I had finished eating my supper, however, they
both quite changed their manner, and the woman apologized
for not having made coffee. The cook had gone to bed and
the fire was out, she said. She presently ordered Byron, as
he brought my saddle in, to get some “light-wood” and
make a fire; said she was afraid I had made a poor supper,
and set a chair by the fire-place for me as I drew away
from the table.</p>

<p>I plied the man with inquiries about his business, got him
interested in points of difference between Northern and
Southern agriculture, and soon had him in quite a sociable
and communicative humour. He gave me much overseer’s
lore about cotton culture, nigger and cattle maladies, the
right way to keep sweet potatoes, etc.; and when I proposed
to ride over the plantation with him in the morning, he said
he “would be very thankful for my company.”</p>

<p>I think they gave up their own bed to me, for it was double,
and had been slept in since the sheets were last changed; the
room was garnished with pistols and other arms and ammunition,
rolls of negro-cloth, shoes and hats, handcuffs, a large
medicine chest, and several books on medical and surgical
subjects and farriery; while articles of both men’s and
women’s wearing apparel hung against the walls, which were
also decorated with some large patent-medicine posters. One
of them is characteristic of the place and the times.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>
<p>We had a good breakfast in the morning, and immediately
afterward mounted and rode to a very large cotton-field,
where the whole field-force of the plantation was engaged.</p>

<p>It was a first-rate plantation. On the highest ground
stood a large and handsome mansion, but it had not been
occupied for several years, and it was more than two years
since the overseer had seen the owner. He lived several
hundred miles away, and the overseer would not believe that I
did not know him, for he was a rich man and an honourable,
and had several times been where I came from—New York.</p>

<p>The whole plantation, including the swamp land around it,
and owned with it, covered several square miles. It was four
miles from the settlement to the nearest neighbour’s house.
There were between thirteen and fourteen hundred acres
under cultivation with cotton, corn, and other hoed crops,
and two hundred hogs running at large in the swamp. It
was the intention that corn and pork enough should be
raised to keep the slaves and cattle. This year, however, it
has been found necessary to purchase largely, and such was
probably usually the case,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> though the overseer intimated the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
owner had been displeased, and he “did not mean to be
caught so bad again.”</p>

<p>There were 135 slaves, big and little, of which 67 went to
field regularly—equal, the overseer thought, to fully 60 prime
hands. Besides these, there were 3 mechanics (blacksmith,
carpenter, and wheelwright), 2 seamstresses, 1 cook, 1 stable
servant, 1 cattle-tender, 1 hog-tender, 1 teamster, 1 house
servant (overseer’s cook), and one midwife and nurse. These
were all first-class hands; most of them would be worth
more, if they were for sale, the overseer said, than the best
field-hands. There was also a driver of the hoe-gang who
did not labour personally, and a foreman of the plough-gang.
These two acted as petty officers in the field, and alternately
in the quarters.</p>

<p>There was a nursery for sucklings at the quarters, and
twenty women at this time who left their work four times
each day, for half an hour, to nurse their young ones. These
women, the overseer counted as half-hands—that is, expected
to do half the day’s work of a prime field-hand in ordinary
condition.</p>

<p>He had just sold a bad runaway to go to Texas, he
happened to remark. He was whipping the fellow, when he
turned and tried to stab him—then broke from him and ran
away. He had him caught almost immediately with the
dogs. After catching him, he kept him in irons till he had
a chance to sell him. His niggers did not very often run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
away, he said, because they had found that he was almost
sure to catch them. As soon as he saw that one was gone
he put the dogs on, and if rain had not just fallen, they
would soon find him. Sometimes they did manage to outwit
the dogs, but then they almost always kept in the neighbourhood,
because they did not like to go where they could not
sometimes get back and see their families, and he would soon
get wind of where they had been; they would come round
their quarters to see their families and to get food, and as
soon as he knew it, he would find their tracks and put the
dogs on again. Two months was the longest time any of
them ever kept out. He had dogs trained on purpose to run
after niggers, and never let out for anything else.</p>

<p>We found in the field thirty ploughs, moving together,
turning the earth from the cotton plants, and from thirty to
forty hoers, the latter mainly women, with a black driver
walking about among them with a whip, which he often
cracked at them, sometimes allowing the lash to fall lightly
upon their shoulders. He was constantly urging them also
with his voice. All worked very steadily, and though the
presence of a stranger on the plantation must have been
a most unusual occurrence, I saw none raise or turn their
heads to look at me. Each gang was attended by a “water-toter,”
that of the hoe-gang being a straight, sprightly,
plump little black girl, whose picture, as she stood balancing
the bucket upon her head, shading her bright eyes with one
hand, and holding out a calabash with the other to maintain
her poise, would have been a worthy study for Murillo.</p>

<p>I asked at what time they began to work in the morning.
“Well,” said the overseer, “I do better by my niggers than
most. I keep ’em right smart at their work while they do
work, but I generally knock ’em off at 8 o’clock in the morning,
Saturdays, and give ’em all the rest of the day to themselves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
and I always gives ’em Sundays, the whole day.
Pickin’ time, and when the crap’s bad in grass, I sometimes
keep ’em to it till about sunset, Saturdays, but I never work
’em Sundays.”</p>

<p>“How early do you start them out in the morning,
usually?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t never start my niggers ’fore daylight, ’less
’tis in pickin’ time, then maybe I get ’em out a quarter of an
hour before. But I keep ’em right smart to work through the
day.” He showed an evident pride in the vigilance of his
driver, and called my attention to the large area of ground
already hoed over that morning; well hoed, too, as he said.</p>

<p>“At what time do they eat?” I asked. They ate “their
snacks” in their cabins, he said, before they came out in the
morning (that is before daylight—the sun rising at this time
at a little before five, and the day dawning, probably, an hour
earlier); then at 12 o’clock their dinner was brought to them
in a cart—one cart for the plough-gang and one for the hoe-gang.
The hoe-gang ate its dinner in the field, and only
stopped work long enough to eat it. The plough-gang drove
its teams to the “weather houses”—open sheds erected for
the purpose in different parts of the plantation, under which
were cisterns filled with rain water, from which the water-toters
carried drink to those at work. The mules were fed with as
much oats (in straw), corn and fodder as they would eat in two
hours; this forage having been brought to the weather houses
by another cart. The ploughmen had nothing to do but eat
their dinner in all this time. All worked as late as they
could see to work well, and had no more food nor rest until
they returned to their cabins.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> At half-past nine o’clock the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
drivers, each on an alternate night, blew a horn, and at ten
visited every cabin to see that its occupants were at rest, and
not lurking about and spending their strength in fooleries,
and that the fires were safe—a very unusual precaution; the
negroes are generally at liberty after their day’s work is done
till they are called in the morning. When washing and
patching were done, wood hauled and cut for the fires, corn
ground, etc., I did not learn: probably all chores not of daily
necessity were reserved for Saturday. Custom varies in this
respect. In general, with regard to fuel for the cabins, the
negroes are left to look out for themselves, and they often
have to go to “the swamp” for it, or at least, if it has been
hauled, to cut it to a convenient size, after their day’s work
is done. The allowance of food was a peck of corn and four
pounds of pork per week, each. When they could not get
“greens” (any vegetables) he generally gave them five
pounds of pork. They had gardens, and raised a good deal
for themselves; they also had fowls, and usually plenty of
eggs. He added, “the man who owns this plantation does
more for his niggers than any other man I know. Every
Christmas he sends me up a thousand or fifteen hundred
dollars’ [equal to eight or ten dollars each] worth of molasses
and coffee, and tobacco, and calico, and Sunday tricks for ’em.
Every family on this plantation gets a barrel of molasses at
Christmas.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>Beside which, the overseer added, they are able, if they
choose, to buy certain comforts for themselves—tobacco for
instance—with money earned by Saturday and Sunday work.
Some of them went into the swamps on Sunday, and made
boards (which means slabs worked out with no other instrument
than an axe). One man sold last year as much as fifty
dollars’ worth.</p>

<p>Finding myself nearer the outer gate than the “quarters,”
when at length my curiosity was satisfied, I did not return to
the house. After getting a clear direction how to find my
way back to the road I had been upon the previous day, I said
to the overseer, with some hesitation, “You will allow me to
pay you for the trouble I have given you?” He looked a
little disconcerted by my putting the question in this way, but
answered in a matter-of-course tone, “It will be a dollar and
a quarter, sir.”</p>

<p>This was the only large plantation I had an opportunity of
seeing at all closely, over which I was not chiefly conducted
by an educated gentleman and slave owner, by whose habitual
impressions and sentiments my own were probably somewhat
influenced. From what I saw in passing, and from what I
heard by chance of others, I suppose it to have been a very
favourable specimen of those plantations on which the owners
do not reside. A merchant of the vicinity recently in New
York tells me that he supposes it to be a fair enough example
of plantations of its class. There is nothing remarkable in
its management, so far as he had heard. When I asked about
the molasses and Christmas presents, he said he reckoned the
overseer must have rather stretched that part of his story, but
the owner was a very good man. A magistrate of the district,
who had often been on the plantation, said in answer to an
inquiry from me, that the negroes were very well treated upon
it, though he did not think they were extraordinarily so. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
comparison was with plantations in general.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> He also spoke
well of the overseer. He had been a long time on this plantation—I
think he said ever since it had begun to be
cultivated. This is very rare; it was the only case I met
with in which an overseer had kept the same place ten years,
and it was a strong evidence of his comparative excellence,
that his employer had been so long satisfied with him.
Perhaps it was a stronger evidence that the owner of the
negroes was a man of good temper, systematic and thorough
in the management of his property.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The condition of the fences, of the mules and tools, and
tillage, which would have been considered admirable in the
best farming district of New York—the dress of the negroes
and the neatness and spaciousness of their “quarters,” which
were superior to those of most of the better class of plantations
on which the owners reside, all bore testimony to a very
unusually prudent and provident policy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>I made no special inquiries about the advantages for
education or means of religious instruction provided for the
slaves. As there seems to be much public desire for definite
information upon that point, I regret that I did not. I did
not need to put questions to the overseer to satisfy my own
mind, however. It was obvious that all natural incitements
to self-advancement had been studiously removed or obstructed,
in subordination to the general purpose of making
the plantation profitable. Regarding only the balance-sheet
of the owner’s ledger, it was admirable management. I am
sorry to have to confess to an impression that it is rare, where
this is the uppermost object of the cotton-planter, that an
equally frugal economy is maintained; and as the general
character of the district along the Mississippi, which is
especially noticeable for the number of large and very productive
plantations which it contains, has now been sufficiently
illustrated, I will here present certain observations which I
wish to make upon the peculiar aspect of slavery in that and
other districts where its profits to the owners of slaves are
most apparent.</p>

<span class="s08">SLAVERY IN ITS PROPERTY ASPECT—MORAL AND RELIGIOUS
INSTRUCTION OF THE SLAVES, ETC.</span></h2>

<p>In a hilly part of Alabama, fifty miles north of the principal
cotton-growing districts of that State, I happened to have a
tradesman of the vicinity for a travelling companion, when,
in passing an unusually large cluster of negro cabins, he
called my attention to a rugged range of hills behind them
which, he said, was a favourite lurking-ground for runaway
negroes. It afforded them numerous coverts for concealment
during the day, and at night the slaves of the plantation
we were passing would help them to find the necessaries of
existence. He had seen folks who had come here to look
after niggers from plantations two hundred miles to the south,
ward. “I suppose,” said he, “’t would seem kind o’ barbarous
to you to see a pack of hounds after a human being?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it would.”</p>

<p>“Some fellows take as much delight in it as in runnin’ a fox.
Always seemed to me a kind o’ barbarous sport.” [A pause.]
“It’s necessary, though.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is. Slavery is a custom of society which
has come to us from a barbarous people, and, naturally, barbarous
practices have to be employed to maintain it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I s’pose that’s so. But niggers is generally pretty
well treated, considering. Some people work their niggers
too hard, that’s a fact. I know a man at ——; he’s a merchant
there, and I have had dealings with him; he’s got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
three plantations, and he puts the hardest overseers he can
get on them. He’s all the time a’ buying niggers, and they
say around there he works ’em to death. On these small
plantations, niggers ain’t very often whipped bad; but on
them big plantations, they’ve got to use ’em hard to keep any
sort of control over ’em. The overseers have to always go about
armed; their life wouldn’t be safe, if they didn’t. As ’tis,
they very often get cut pretty bad.” (Cutting is knifing;
it may be stabbing, in south-western parlance).</p>

<p>He went on to describe what he had seen on some large
plantations which he had visited for business purposes—indications,
as he thought, in the appearance of “the people,” that
they were being “worked to death.” “These rich men,” he
said, “are always bidding for the overseer who will make the
most cotton; and a great many of the overseers didn’t care for
anything but to be able to say they’ve made so many bales in
a year. If they make plenty of cotton, the owners never ask
how many niggers they kill.”</p>

<p>I suggested that this did not seem quite credible; a negro
was a valuable piece of property. It would be foolish to use
him in such a way.</p>

<p>“Seems they don’t think so,” he answered. “They are
always bragging—you must have heard them—how many
bales their overseer has made, or how many their plantation
has made to a hand. They never think of anything else.
You see, if a man did like to have his niggers taken care of,
he couldn’t bear to be always hearing that all the plantations
round had beat his. He’d think the fault was in his overseer.
The fellow who can make the most cotton always gets paid
the best.”</p>

<p>Overseers’ wages were ordinarily from $200 to $600, but a
real driving overseer would very often get $1,000. Sometimes
they’d get $1,200 or $1,500. He heard of $2,000 being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
paid one fellow. A determined and perfectly relentless man—I
can’t recall his exact words, which were very expressive—a
real devil of an overseer, would get almost any wages
he’d ask; because, when it was told round that such a man
had made so many bales to the hand, everybody would be
trying to get him.</p>

<p>The man who talked in this way was a native Alabamian,
ignorant, but apparently of more than ordinarily reflective
habits, and he had been so situated as to have unusually good
opportunities for observation. In character, if not in detail,
I must say that his information was entirely in accordance
with the opinions I should have been led to form from the
conversations I heard by chance, from time to time, in the
richest cotton districts. That his statements as to the bad
management of large plantations, in respect to the waste of
negro property, were not much exaggerated, I find frequent
evidence in southern agricultural journals. The following is
an extract from one of a series of essays published in <i>The
Cotton Planter</i>, the chief object of which is to persuade
planters that they are under no necessity to employ slaves
exclusively in the production of cotton. The writer, Mr.
M. W. Phillips, is a well-known, intelligent, and benevolent
planter, who resides constantly on his estate, near Jackson,
Mississippi:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have known many in the rich planting portion of Mississippi especially,
and others elsewhere, who, acting on the policy of the boy in the
fable, who ‘killed the goose for the golden egg,’ accumulated property, yet
among those who have relied solely on their product in land and negroes,
I doubt if this be the true policy of plantation economy. With the former
everything has to bend, give way to large crops of cotton, land has to be
cultivated wet or dry, negroes to work, cold or hot. Large crops planted,
and they must be cultivated, or done so after a manner. When disease
comes about, as, for instance, cholera, pneumonia, flux, and other violent
diseases, these are more subject, it seemeth to me, than others, or even if
not, there is less vitality to work on, and, therefore, in like situations and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
similar in severity, they must sink with more certainty; or even should
the animal economy rally under all these trials, the neglect consequent
upon this ‘cut and cover’ policy must result in greater mortality. Another
objection, not one-fourth of the children born are raised, and perhaps not
over two-thirds are born on the place, which, under a different policy,
might be expected. And this is not all: hands, and teams, and land must
wear out sooner; admitting this to be only one year sooner in twenty years,
or that lands and negroes are less productive at forty than at forty-two, we
see a heavy loss. Is this not so? I am told of negroes not over thirty-five
to forty-five, who look older than others at forty-five to fifty-five. I know
a man now, not short of sixty, who might readily be taken for forty-five;
another on the same place full fifty (for I have known both for twenty-eight
years, and the last one for thirty-two years), who could be sold for thirty-five,
and these negroes are very leniently dealt with. Others, many others,
I know and have known twenty-five to thirty years, of whom I can speak of
as above. As to rearing children, I can point to equally as strong cases;
ay, men who are, ‘as it were,’ of one family, differing as much as four and
eight bales in cropping, and equally as much in raising young negroes.
The one scarcely paying expenses by his crop, yet in the past twenty-five
years raising over seventy-five to a hundred negroes, the other buying more
than raised, and yet not as many as the first.</p>

<p>“I regard the ‘just medium’ to be the correct point. Labour is conducive
to health; a healthy woman will rear most children. I favour good and
fair work, yet not overworked so as to tax the animal economy, that the
woman cannot rear healthy children, nor should the father be over-wrought,
that his vital powers be at all infringed upon.</p>

<p>“If the policy be adopted, to make an improvement in land visible, to
raise the greatest number of healthy children, to make an abundance of
provision, to rear a portion at least of work horses, rely on it we will soon
find by our tax list that our country is improving. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Brethren of the South, we must change our policy. <i>Overseers are not
interested in raising children, or meat, in improving land, or improving productive
qualities of seed, or animals. Many of them do not care whether
property has depreciated or improved, so they have made a crop [of cotton] to
boast of.</i></p>

<p>“As to myself, I care not who has the credit of making crops at Log
Hall; and I would prefer that an overseer, who has been one of my family
for a year or two, or more, should be benefited; but this thing is to be
known and well understood. I plant such fields in such crops as I see fit;
I plant acres in corn, cotton, oats, potatoes, etc., as I select, and the general
policy of rest, cultivation, etc., must be preserved which I lay down. A
self-willed overseer may fraudulently change somewhat in the latter, by
not carrying out orders—that I cannot help. What I have written, I have
written, and think I can substantiate.”</p>

<p>From the <i>Southern Agriculturist</i>, vol. iv., page 317:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“OVERSEERS.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp; “When they seek a place, they rest their claims entirely on
the number of bags they have heretofore made to the hand, and generally
the employer unfortunately recognizes the justice of such claims.</p>

<p>“No wonder, then, that the overseer desires to have entire control of
the plantation. No wonder he opposes all experiments, or, if they are persisted
in, neglects them; <i>presses everything at the end of the lash; pays no
attention to the sick, except to keep them in the field as long as possible; and
drives them out again at the first moment, and forces sucklers and breeders to
the utmost. He has no other interest than to make a big cotton crop.</i> And if
this does not please you, and induce you to increase his wages, he knows
men it will please, and secure him a situation with.”</p>
</div>

<p>From the Columbia <i>South Carolinian</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp; “Planters may be divided into two great classes, viz., those
who attend to their business, and those who do not. And this creates
corresponding classes of overseers. The planter who does not manage his
own business must, of course, surrender everything into the hands of his
overseer. Such a planter usually rates the merits of the overseer exactly
in proportion to the number of bags of cotton he makes, and of course the
overseer cares for nothing but to make a large crop. To him it is of no
consequence that the old hands are worked down, or the young ones overstrained;
that the breeding women miscarry, and the sucklers lose their
children; that the mules are broken down, the plantation tools destroyed,
the stock neglected, and the lands ruined: <i>so that he has the requisite
number of cotton bags, all is overlooked</i>; he is re-employed at an advanced
salary, and his reputation increased. Everybody knows that by such a
course, a crop may be increased by the most inferior overseer, in any given
year, unless his predecessors have so entirely exhausted the resources of
the plantation, that there is no part of the capital left which can be wrought
up into current income. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp; Having once had the sole management
of a plantation, and imbibed the idea that the only test of good planting is
to make a large crop of cotton, an overseer becomes worthless. He will no
longer obey orders; he will not stoop to details; he scorns all improvements,
and <i>will not</i> adopt any other plan of planting than simply to work
lands, negroes, and mules to the top of their bent, which necessarily proves
fatal to every employer who will allow it.</p>

<p>“It seems scarcely credible, that any man owning a plantation will so
abandon it and his people on it entirely to a hireling, no matter what his
confidence in him is. Yet there are numbers who do it habitually; and I
have even known overseers to stipulate that their employers should not give
any order, nor interfere in any way with their management of the plantation.
There are also some proprietors of considerable property and pretension<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
to being planters, who give their overseer a proportion of the crop for
his wages; thus bribing him by the strongest inducements of self-interest,
to overstrain and work down everything committed to his charge.</p>

<p>“No planter, who attends to his own business, can dispense with agents
and sub-agents. It is impossible, on a plantation of any size, for the
proprietor to attend to all the details, many of which are irksome and
laborious, and he requires more intelligence to assist him than slaves
usually possess. To him, therefore, a good overseer is a blessing. But an
overseer who would answer the views of such a planter is most difficult to
find. The men engaged in that occupation who combine the most intelligence,
industry, and character, are allured into the service of those who
place all power in their hands, and are ultimately spoiled.”</p>
</div>

<p>An English traveller writes to the London <i>Daily News</i>
from Mississippi (1857):—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On crossing the Big Block river, I left the sandhills and began to find
myself in the rich loam of the valley of the Mississippi. The plantations
became larger, the clearings more numerous and extensive, and the roads
less hilly, but worse. Along the Yazoo river one meets with some of the
richest soil in the world, and some of the largest crops of cotton in the
Union. My first night in that region was passed at the house of a planter
who worked but few hands, was a fast friend of slavery, and yet drew for
my benefit one of the most mournful pictures of a slave’s life I have ever
met with. He said, and I believe truly, that the negroes of small planters
are, on the whole, well treated, or at least as well as the owners can afford
to treat them. Their master not unfrequently works side by side with them
in the fields. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp; But on the large plantations, where the business
is carried on by an overseer, and everything is conducted with military
strictness and discipline, he described matters as being widely different.
<i>The future of the overseer depends altogether on the quantity of cotton he is
able to make up for the market.</i> Whether the owner be resident or non-resident,
if the plantation be large, and a great number of hands be employed
upon it, the overseer gets credit for a large crop, and blame for a
small one. His professional reputation depends in a great measure upon
the number of bales or hogsheads he is able to produce, and neither his
education nor his habits are such as to render it likely that he would allow
any consideration for the negroes to stand in the way of his advancing it.
His interest is to get as much work out of them as they can possibly
perform. His skill consists in knowing exactly how hard they may be
driven without incapacitating them for future exertion. The larger the
plantation the less chance there is, of course, of the owner’s softening the
rigour of the overseer, or the sternness of discipline by personal interference.
So, as Mr. H—— said, a vast mass of the slaves pass their lives, from the
moment they are able to go afield in the picking season till they drop worn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
out into the grave, in incessant labour, in all sorts of weather, at all seasons
of the year, without any other change or relaxation than is furnished by
sickness, without the smallest hope of any improvement either in their
condition, in their food, or in their clothing, which are of the plainest and
coarsest kind, and indebted solely to the forbearance or good temper of the
overseer for exemption from terrible physical suffering. They are rung to
bed at nine o’clock, almost immediately after bolting the food which they
often have to cook after coming home from their day’s labour, and are rung
out of bed at four or five in the morning. The interval is one long round
of toil. Life has no sunny spots for them. Their only refuge or consolation
in this world is in their own stupidity and grossness. The nearer they
are to the beast, the happier they are likely to be. Any mental or moral
rise is nearly sure to bring unhappiness with it.”</p>
</div>

<p>The same gentleman writes from Columbus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One gets better glimpses of the real condition of the negroes from conversations
one happens to overhear than from what is told to one’s-self—above
all, when one is known to be a stranger, and particularly an Englishman.
The cool way in which you hear the hanging of niggers, the shooting
of niggers, and the necessity for severe discipline among niggers talked of
in bar-rooms, speaks volumes as to the exact state of the case. A negro
was shot when running away, near Greensboro’, a small town on my road,
the day before I passed through, by a man who had received instructions
from the owner to take him alive, and shoot him if he resisted. I heard
the subject discussed by some ‘loafers’ in the bar, while getting my horse
fed, and I found, to my no small—I do not know whether to say horror or
amusement—that the point in dispute was not the degree of moral guilt
incurred by the murderer, but the degree of loss and damage for which he
had rendered himself liable to the owner of the slave in departing from the
letter of his commission. One of the group summed up the arguments on
both sides, by exclaiming, ‘Well, this shootin’ of niggers should be put a
stop to, that’s a fact.’ The obvious inference to be deduced from this
observation was, that ‘nigger shootin’’ was a slight contravention of police
regulations—a little of which might be winked at, but which, in this
locality, had been carried to such an extent as to call for the interference
of the law.”</p>
</div>

<p>I do not think that I have ever seen the sudden death of a
negro noticed in a Southern newspaper, or heard it referred
to in conversation, that the loss of property, rather than the
extinction of life, was not the evident occasion of interest.
Turning over several Southern papers at this moment, I fall
at once upon these examples:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We are informed that a negro man, the property of Mr. William Mays,
of this city, was killed last Thursday by a youth, the son of Mr. William
Payne, of Campbell county. The following are the circumstances, as we
have received them. Two sons of Mr. Payne were shooting pigeons on the
plantation of Mr. Mays, about twenty miles from this place, and went to
the tobacco-house, where the overseer and hands were housing tobacco;
one of the boys had a string of pigeons and the other had none. On
reaching the house, the negro who was killed asked the boy who had no
pigeons, ‘where his were.’ He replied that he killed none, but could kill
him (the negro), and raised his gun and fired. The load took effect in
the head, and caused death in a few hours. <i>The negro was a valuable one.
Mr. Mays had refused $1,200 for him.</i>”—<i>Lynchburg Virginian.</i></p>

<p>“<i>A valuable negro boy, the property of</i> W. A. Phipps, living in the upper
end of this county, was accidentally drowned in the Holston river a few
days ago.”—<i>Rogersville Times.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Tilghman Cobb’s barn at Bedford, Va., was set fire to by lightning
on Friday, the 11th, and consumed. Two negroes and three horses
perished in the flames.”—<i>New Orleans Daily Crescent.</i></p>
</div>

<p>I have repeated these accounts, not to convey to the reader’s
mind the impression that slaves are frequently shot by their
masters, which would be, no doubt, a mistaken inference, but
to show in what manner I was made to feel, as I was very
strongly in my journey, that what we call the sacredness of
human life, together with a great range of kindred instincts,
scarcely attaches at all, with most white men, to the slaves,
and also in order to justify the following observation:—that I
found the lives and the comfort of negroes, in the rich cotton-planting
districts especially, habitually regarded, by all
classes, much more from a purely pecuniary point of view
than I had ever before supposed they could be; and yet
that, as property, negro life and negro vigour were generally
much less carefully economized than I had always before
imagined them to be.</p>

<p>As I became familiar with the circumstances, I saw reasons
for this, which, in looking from a distance, or through the
eyes of travellers, I had not been able adequately to appreciate.
I will endeavour to state them:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>It is difficult to handle simply as property, a creature
possessing human passions and human feelings, however
debased and torpid the condition of that creature may be;
while, on the other hand, the absolute necessity of dealing
with property as a thing, greatly embarrassed a man in any
attempt to treat it as a person. And it is the natural result of
this complicated state of things, that the system of slave-management
is irregular, ambiguous, and contradictory; that it is
never either consistently humane or consistently economical.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the larger the body of negroes on a
plantation or estate, the more completely are they treated
as mere property, and in accordance with a policy calculated
to insure the largest pecuniary returns. Hence, in part, the
greater proportionate profit of such plantations, and the tendency
which everywhere prevails in the planting districts to
the absorption of small, and the augmentation of large estates.
It may be true, that among the wealthier slave-owners there
is oftener a humane disposition, a better judgment, and a
greater ability to deal with their dependents indulgently and
bountifully, but the effects of this disposition are chiefly felt,
even on those plantations where the proprietor resides permanently,
among the slaves employed about the house and
stables, and perhaps a few old favourites in the quarters. It
is more than balanced by the difficulty of acquiring a personal
interest in the units of a large body of slaves, and an acquaintance
with the individual characteristics of each. The treatment
of the mass must be reduced to a system, the ruling
idea of which will be, to enable one man to force into the
same channel of labour the muscles of a large number of men
of various and often conflicting wills.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty is to overcome their great aversion to
labour. They have no objection to eating, drinking, and
resting, when necessary, and no general disinclination to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
receive instruction. If a man own many slaves, therefore,
the faculty which he values highest, and pays most for, in
an overseer, is that of making them work. Any fool could
see that they were properly supplied with food, clothing, rest,
and religious instruction.</p>

<p>The labourers we see in towns, at work on railroads and
steamboats, about stations and landings; the menials of our
houses and hotels, are less respectable, moral, and intelligent
than the great majority of the whole labouring class of the
North. The traveller at the South has to learn that there
the reverse is the case to a degree which can hardly be
sufficiently estimated. I have been obliged to think that
many amiable travellers who have received impressions with
regard to the condition of the slaves very different from mine,
have failed to make a sufficient allowance for this. The
rank-and-file plantation negroes are not to be readily made
acquaintance with by chance or through letters of introduction.</p>

<p>I have described in detail, in former chapters, two large
plantations, which were much the best in respect to the
happiness of the negroes, of all that I saw in the South. I
am now about to describe what I judged to be the most
profitable estate that I visited. In saying this I do not
compare it with others noticed in this chapter, my observations
of which were too superficial to warrant a comparison.
It was situated upon a tributary of the Mississippi, and
accessible only by occasional steamboats; even this mode of
communication being frequently interrupted at low stages of
the rivers. The slaves upon it formed about one twentieth
of the whole population of the county, in which the blacks
considerably outnumber the whites. At the time of my
visit, the owner was sojourning upon it, with his family and
several invited guests, but his usual residence was upon a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
small plantation, of little productive value, situated in a
neighbourhood somewhat noted for the luxury and hospitality
of its citizens, and having a daily mail, and direct railroad
and telegraphic communication with New York. This was,
if I am not mistaken, his second visit in five years.</p>

<p>The property consisted of four adjoining plantations, each
with its own negro-cabins, stables, and overseer, and each
worked to a great extent independently of the others, but
all contributing their crop to one gin-house and warehouse,
and all under the general superintendence of a bailiff or
manager, who constantly resided upon the estate, and in the
absence of the owner, had vice-regal power over the overseers,
controlling, so far as he thought fit, the economy of all
the plantations.</p>

<p>The manager was himself a gentleman of good education,
generous and poetic in temperament, and possessing a capacity
for the enjoyment of nature and a happiness in the
bucolic life, unfortunately rare with Americans. I found him
a delightful companion, and I have known no man with whose
natural tastes and feelings I have felt, on so short acquaintance,
a more hearty sympathy. The gang of toiling negroes
to him, however, was as essential an element of the poetry
of nature as flocks of peaceful sheep and herds of lowing kine,
and he would no more appreciate the aspect in which an
Abolitionist would see them, than would Virgil have honoured
the feelings of a vegetarian, sighing at the sight of flocks
and herds destined to feed the depraved appetite of the
carnivorous savage of modern civilization. The overseers
were superior to most of their class, and, with one exception,
frank, honest, temperate, and industrious, but their feelings
toward negroes were such as naturally result from their
occupation. They were all married, and lived with their
families, each in a cabin or cottage, in the hamlet of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
slaves of which he had especial charge. Their wages varied
from $500 to $1,000 a year each.</p>

<p>These five men, each living more than a mile distant from
either of the others, were the only white men on the estate,
and the only others within several miles of them were a few
skulking vagabonds. Of course, to secure their own personal
safety and to efficiently direct the labour of such a large
number of ignorant, indolent, and vicious negroes, rules, or
rather habits and customs, of discipline, were necessary,
which would in particular cases be liable to operate unjustly
and cruelly. It is apparent, also, that, as the testimony of
negroes against them would not be received as evidence in
court, that there was very little probability that any excessive
severity would be restrained by fear of the law. A provision
of the law intended to secure a certain privilege to slaves,
was indeed disregarded under my own observation, and such
infraction of the law was confessedly customary with one of
the overseers, and was permitted by the manager, for the
reason that it seemed to him to be, in a certain degree, justifiable
and expedient under the circumstances, and because he
did not like to interfere unnecessarily in such matters.</p>

<p>In the main, the negroes appeared to be well taken care of
and abundantly supplied with the necessaries of vigorous
physical existence. A large part of them lived in commodious
and well-built cottages, with broad galleries in front, so
that each family of five had two rooms on the lower floor, and
a loft. The remainder lived in log huts, small and mean in
appearance, but those of their overseers were little better, and
preparations were being made to replace all of these by neat
boarded cottages. Each family had a fowl-house and hog-sty
(constructed by the negroes themselves), and kept fowls and
swine, feeding the latter during the summer on weeds and
fattening them in the autumn on corn, <i>stolen</i> (this was mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
to me by the overseers as if it were a matter of course)
from their master’s corn-fields. I several times saw gangs of
them eating the dinner which they had brought, each man
for himself, to the field, and observed that they generally had
plenty, often more than they could eat, of bacon, corn-bread,
and molasses. The allowance of food is weighed and measured
under the eye of the manager by the drivers, and distributed
to the head of each family weekly: consisting of—for
each person, 3 pounds of pork, 1 peck of meal; and from
January to July, 1 quart of molasses. Monthly, in addition,
1 pound tobacco, and 4 pints salt. No drink is ever served
but water, except after unusual exposure, or to ditchers working
in water, who get a glass of whisky at night. All hands
cook for themselves after work at night, or whenever they
please between nightfall and daybreak, each family in its own
cabin. Each family has a garden, the products of which, together
with eggs, fowls, and bacon, they frequently sell, or
use in addition to their regular allowance of food. Most of
the families buy a barrel of flour every year. The manager
endeavours to encourage this practice; and that they may spend
their money for flour instead of liquor, he furnishes it to them
at rather less than what it costs him at wholesale. There are
many poor whites within a few miles who will always sell
liquor to the negroes, and encourage them to steal, to obtain
the means to buy it of them. These poor whites are always
spoken of with anger by the overseers, and they each have a
standing offer of much more than the intrinsic value of their
land, from the manager, to induce them to move away.</p>

<p>The negroes also obtain a good deal of game. They set
traps for raccoons, rabbits, and turkeys; and I once heard the
stock-tender complaining that he had detected one of the
vagabond whites stealing a turkey which had been caught in
his pen. I several times partook of game, while on the plantation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
that had been purchased of the negroes. The stock-tender,
an old negro, whose business it was to ride about in
the woods and keep an eye on the stock cattle that were
pastured in them, and who was thus likely to know where
the deer ran, had an ingenious way of supplying himself with
venison. He lashed a scythe blade or butcher’s knife to the
end of a pole so that it formed a lance; this he set near a
fence or fallen tree which obstructed a path in which the deer
habitually ran, and the deer in leaping over the obstacle would
leap directly on the knife. In this manner he had killed two
deer the week before my visit.</p>

<p>The manager sent to him for some of this venison for his
own use, and justified himself to me for not paying for it on
the ground that the stock-tender had undoubtedly taken time
which really belonged to his owner to set his spear. Game
taken by the field-hands was not looked upon in the same
light, because it must have been got at night when they were
excused from labour for their owner.</p>

<p>The first morning I was on the estate, while at breakfast
with the manager, an old negro woman came into the room
and said to him, “Dat gal’s bin bleedin’ agin’ dis mornin’.”</p>

<p>“How much did she bleed?”</p>

<p>“About a pint, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well; I’ll call and see her after breakfast.”</p>

<p>“I come up for some sugar of lead, masser; I gin her some
powdered alum ’fore I come away.”</p>

<p>“Very well; you can have some.”</p>

<p>After breakfast the manager invited me to ride with him
on his usual daily round of inspection through the plantations.</p>

<p>On reaching the nearest “quarters,” we stopped at a house,
a little larger than the ordinary cabins, which was called the
loom-house, in which a dozen negroes were at work making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
shoes, and manufacturing coarse cotton stuff for negro clothing.
One of the hands so employed was insane, and most of
the others were cripples, invalids with chronic complaints, or
unfitted by age, or some infirmity, for field-work.</p>

<p>From this we went to one of the cabins, where we found
the sick woman who had been bleeding at the lungs, with the
old nurse in attendance upon her. The manager examined
and prescribed for her in a kind manner. When we came
out he asked the nurse if any one else was sick.</p>

<p>“Oney dat woman Carline.”</p>

<p>“What do you think is the matter with her?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t tink dere’s anyting de matter wid her,
masser; I mus’ answer you for true, I don’t tink anyting de
matter wid her, oney she’s a little sore from dat whippin’ she
got.”</p>

<p>We went to another cabin and entered a room where a
woman lay on a bed, groaning. It was a dingy, comfortless
room, but a musquito bar, much patched and very dirty,
covered the bed. The manager asked the woman several
times what was the matter, but could get no distinct reply.
She appeared to be suffering great pain. The manager felt
her pulse and looked at her tongue, and after making a few
more inquiries, to which no intelligible reply was given,
told her he did not believe she was ill at all. At this
the woman’s groans redoubled. “I have heard of your
tricks,” continued the manager; “you had a chill when I
came to see you yesterday morning; you had a chill when
the mistress came here, and you had a chill when the master
came. I never knew a chill to last the whole day. So you’ll
just get up now and go to the field, and if you don’t work
smart, you’ll get a dressing; do you hear?”</p>

<p>We then left. The manager said that he rarely—almost
never—had occasion to employ a physician for the people.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
Never for accouchements; the women, from their labour in
the field, were not subject to the difficulty, danger, and pain
which attended women of the better classes in giving birth
to their offspring. (I do not suppose that there was a
physician within a day’s journey of the plantations.)</p>

<p>Near the first quarters we visited there was a large blacksmith’s
and wheelwright’s shop, in which a number of
mechanics were at work. Most of them, as we rode up,
were eating their breakfast, which they warmed at their fires.
Within and around the shop there were some fifty ploughs
which they were putting in order. The manager inspected
the work, found some of it faulty, sharply reprimanded the
workmen for not getting on faster, and threatened one of
them with a whipping for not paying closer attention to the
directions which had been given him.</p>

<p>The overseer of this plantation rode up while we were at
the shop, and in a free and easy style, reported to the
manager how all his hands were employed. There were so
many at this and so many at that, and they had done so
much since yesterday. “There’s that girl, Caroline,” said
the manager; “she’s not sick, and I told her she must go to
work; put her to the hoeing; there’s nothing the matter
with her, except she’s sore with the whipping she got. You
must go and get her out.” A woman passing at the time,
the manager told her to go and tell Caroline she must get
up and go to work, or the overseer would come and start
her. She returned in a few minutes, and reported that Caroline
said she could not get up. The overseer and manager
rode toward the cabin, but before they reached it, the girl,
who had probably been watching us from the window, came
out and went to the field with her hoe. They then returned
to me and continued their conversation. Just before we left
the overseer, he said, “I think that girl who ran away last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
week was in her cabin last night.” The manager told me,
as we rode on, that the people often ran away after they have
been whipped, or something else had happened to make them
angry. They hide in the swamp, and come in to the cabins
at night to get food. They seldom remain away more than
a fortnight, and when they come in they are whipped. The
woman, Caroline, he said, had been delivered of a dead child
about six weeks before, and had been complaining and
getting rid of work ever since. She was the laziest woman
on the estate. This shamming illness gave him the most
disagreeable duty he had to perform. Negroes were famous
for it. “If it was not for her bad character,” he continued,
“I should fear to make her go to work to-day; but her
pulse is steady, and her tongue perfectly smooth. We have
to be sharp with them; if we were not, every negro on the
estate would be a-bed.”</p>

<p>We rode on to where the different gangs of labourers were
at work, and inspected them one after another. I observed,
as we were looking at one of the gangs, that they were very
dirty. “Negroes are the filthiest people in the world,” said
the manager; “there are some of them who would not keep
clean twenty-four hours at a time if you gave them thirty
suits a year.” I asked him if there were any rules to
maintain cleanliness. There were not, but sometimes the
negroes were told at night that any one who came into the
field the next morning without being clean would be
whipped. This gave no trouble to those who were habitually
clean, while it was in itself a punishment to those
who were not, as they were obliged to spend the night in
washing.</p>

<p>They were furnished with two suits of summer, and one of
winter clothing each year. Besides which, most of them got
presents of holiday finery (calico dresses, handkerchiefs, etc.),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
and purchased more for themselves, at Christmas. One
of the drivers now in the field had on a uniform coat of an
officer of artillery. After the Mexican war, a great deal of
military clothing was sold at auction in New Orleans, and
much of it was bought by the planters at a low price, and
given to their negroes, who were greatly pleased with it.</p>

<p>Each overseer regulated the hours of work on his own
plantation. I saw the negroes at work before sunrise and
after sunset. At about eight o’clock they were allowed to
stop for breakfast, and again about noon, to dine. The length
of these rests was at the discretion of the overseer or drivers,
usually, I should say, from half an hour to an hour. There
was no rule.</p>

<p>The number of hands directed by each overseer was considerably
over one hundred. The manager thought it would
be better economy to have a white man over every fifty hands,
but the difficulty of obtaining trustworthy overseers prevented
it. Three of those he then had were the best he had ever
known. He described the great majority as being passionate,
careless, inefficient men, generally intemperate, and totally
unfitted for the duties of the position. The best overseers
ordinarily, are young men, the sons of small planters, who
take up the business temporarily, as a means of acquiring
a little capital with which to purchase negroes for themselves.</p>

<p>The ploughs at work, both with single and double mule
teams, were generally held by women, and very well held, too.
I watched with some interest for any indication that their sex
unfitted them for the occupation. Twenty of them were
ploughing together, with double teams and heavy ploughs.
They were superintended by a negro man who carried a whip,
which he frequently cracked at them, permitting no dawdling
or delay at the turning; and they twitched their ploughs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
around on the head-land, jerking their reins, and yelling to
their mules, with apparent ease, energy, and rapidity.
Throughout the South-west the negroes, as a rule, appear to
be worked much harder than in the Eastern and Northern
Slave States. I do not think they accomplish as much in
the same time as agricultural labourers at the North usually
do, but they certainly labour much harder, and more unremittingly.
They are constantly and steadily driven up to
their work, and the stupid, plodding, machine-like manner in
which they labour, is painful to witness. This was especially
the case with the hoe-gangs. One of them numbered nearly
two hundred hands (for the force of two plantations was working
together), moving across the field in parallel lines, with
a considerable degree of precision. I repeatedly rode through
the lines at a canter, with other horsemen, often coming upon
them suddenly, without producing the smallest change or interruption
in the dogged action of the labourers, or causing
one of them, so far as I could see, to lift an eye from the
ground. I had noticed the same thing with smaller numbers
before, but here, considering that I was a stranger, and that
strangers could but very rarely visit the plantation, it amazed
me very much. I think it told a more painful story than any I
had ever heard, of the cruelty of slavery. It was emphasized
by a tall and powerful negro who walked to and fro in the rear
of the line, frequently cracking his whip, and calling out in
the surliest manner, to one and another, “Shove your hoe,
there! shove your hoe!” But I never saw him strike any
one with the whip.</p>

<p>The whip was evidently in constant use, however. There
were no rules on the subject, that I learned; the overseers and
drivers punished the negroes whenever they deemed it necessary,
and in such manner, and with such severity, as they
thought fit. “If you don’t work faster,” or “If you don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
work better,” or “If you don’t recollect what I tell you, I
will have you flogged,” I often heard. I said to one of the
overseers, “It must be disagreeable to have to punish them
as much as you do?” “Yes, it would be to those who are
not used to it—but it’s my business, and I think nothing of
it. Why, sir, I wouldn’t mind killing a nigger more than I
would a dog.” I asked if he had ever killed a negro? “Not
quite that,” he said, but overseers were often obliged to.
Some negroes are determined never to let a white man whip
them, and will resist you, when you attempt it; of course
you must kill them in that case.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Once a negro, whom he
was about to whip in the field, struck at his head with a
hoe. He parried the blow with his whip, and, drawing a pistol,
tried to shoot him; but the pistol missing fire, he rushed in and
knocked him down with the butt of it. At another time, a
negro whom he was punishing insulted and threatened him.
He went to the house for his gun, and as he was returning,
the negro, thinking he would be afraid of spoiling so valuable
a piece of property by firing, broke for the woods. He fired
at once, and put six buck-shot into his hips. He always
carried a bowie-knife, but not a pistol unless he anticipated
some unusual act of insubordination. He always kept a pair
of pistols ready loaded over the mantel-piece, however, in case
they should be needed. It was only when he first came upon
a plantation that he ever had much trouble. A great many
overseers were unfit for their business, and too easy and slack
with the negroes. When he succeeded such a man, he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
hard work for a time to break the negroes in; but it did not
take long to teach them their place. His conversation on the
subject was exactly like what I have heard said, again and
again, by northern shipmasters and officers, with regard to
seamen.</p>

<p>I happened to see the severest corporeal punishment of a
negro that I witnessed at the South while visiting this estate.
I suppose, however, that punishment equally severe is common;
in fact, it must be necessary to the maintenance of
adequate discipline on every large plantation. It is much
more necessary than on shipboard, because the opportunities
of hiding away and shirking labour, and of wasting and injuring
the owner’s property without danger to themselves, are
far greater in the case of the slaves than in that of the sailors,
but, above all, because there is no real moral obligation on the
part of the negro to do what is demanded of him. The sailor
performs his duty in obedience to a voluntary contract; the
slave is in an involuntary servitude. The manner of the overseer
who inflicted the punishment, and his subsequent conversation
with me about it, indicated that it was by no means
unusual in severity. I had accidentally encountered him, and
he was showing me his plantation. In going from one side
of it to the other, we had twice crossed a deep gully, at the
bottom of which was a thick covert of brushwood. We were
crossing it a third time, and had nearly passed through the
brush, when the overseer suddenly stopped his horse exclaiming,
“What’s that? Hallo! who are you, there?”</p>

<p>It was a girl lying at full length on the ground at the bottom
of the gully, evidently intending to hide herself from us
in the bushes.</p>

<p>“Who are you, there?”</p>

<p>“Sam’s Sall, sir.”</p>

<p>“What are you skulking there for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>The girl half rose, but gave no answer.</p>

<p>“Have you been here all day?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“How did you get here?”</p>

<p>The girl made no reply.</p>

<p>“Where have you been all day?”</p>

<p>The answer was unintelligible.</p>

<p>After some further questioning, she said her father accidentally
locked her in, when he went out in the morning.</p>

<p>“How did you manage to get out?”</p>

<p>“Pushed a plank off, sir, and crawled out.”</p>

<p>The overseer was silent for a moment, looking at the girl,
and then said, “That won’t do; come out here.” The girl
arose at once, and walked towards him. She was about
eighteen years of age. A bunch of keys hung at her waist,
which the overseer espied, and he said, “Your father locked
you in; but you have got the keys.” After a little hesitation,
she replied that these were the keys of some other locks;
her father had the door-key.</p>

<p>Whether her story were true or false, could have been
ascertained in two minutes by riding on to the gang with
which her father was at work, but the overseer had made up
his mind.</p>

<p>“That won’t do;” said he, “get down.” The girl knelt on
the ground; he got off his horse, and holding him with his left
hand, struck her thirty or forty blows across the shoulders with
his tough, flexible, “raw-hide” whip (a terrible instrument for
the purpose). They were well laid on, at arm’s length, but with
no appearance of angry excitement on the part of the overseer.
At every stroke the girl winced and exclaimed, “Yes, sir!”
or “Ah, sir!” or “Please, sir!” not groaning or screaming.
At length he stopped and said, “Now tell me the truth.” The
girl repeated the same story. “You have not got enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
yet,” said he; “pull up your clothes—lie down.” The girl
without any hesitation, without a word or look of remonstrance
or entreaty, drew closely all her garments under her
shoulders, and lay down upon the ground with her face toward
the overseer, who continued to flog her with the raw hide,
across her naked loins and thighs, with as much strength as
before. She now shrunk away from him, not rising, but
writhing, grovelling, and screaming, “Oh, don’t sir! oh,
please stop, master! please, sir! please, sir! oh, that’s
enough, master! oh, Lord! oh, master, master! oh, God
master, do stop! oh, God, master! oh, God, master!”</p>

<p>A young gentleman of fifteen was with us; he had ridden
in front, and now, turning on his horse, looked back with an
expression only of impatience at the delay. It was the first time
I had ever seen a woman flogged. I had seen a man cudgelled
and beaten, in the heat of passion, before, but never
flogged with a hundredth part of the severity used in this
case. I glanced again at the perfectly passionless but rather
grim business-like face of the overseer, and again at the young
gentleman, who had turned away; if not indifferent he had
evidently not the faintest sympathy with my emotion. Only
my horse chafed. I gave him rein and spur and we plunged
into the bushes and scrambled fiercely up the steep acclivity.
The screaming yells and the whip strokes had ceased when I
reached the top of the bank. Choking, sobbing, spasmodic
groans only were heard. I rode on to where the road,
coming diagonally up the ravine, ran out upon the cotton-field.
My young companion met me there, and immediately
afterward the overseer. He laughed as he joined us, and said:</p>

<p>“She meant to cheat me out of a day’s work, and she has
done it, too.”</p>

<p>“Did you succeed in getting another story from her?” I
asked, as soon as I could trust myself to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>“No; she stuck to it.”</p>

<p>“Was it not perhaps true?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, sir; she slipped out of the gang when they were
going to work, and she’s been dodging about all day, going
from one place to another as she saw me coming. She saw
us crossing there a little while ago, and thought we had gone
to the quarters, but we turned back so quick, we came into
the gully before she knew it, and she could do nothing but
lie down in the bushes.”</p>

<p>“I suppose they often slip off so.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I never had one do so before—not like this;
they often run away to the woods, and are gone some time,
but I never had a dodge-off like this before.”</p>

<p>“Was it necessary to punish her so severely?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, sir,” (laughing again.) “If I hadn’t, she would
have done the same thing again to-morrow, and half the
people on the plantation would have followed her example.
Oh, you’ve no idea how lazy these niggers are; you Northern
people don’t know anything about it. They’d never do any
work at all if they were not afraid of being whipped.”</p>

<p>We soon afterward met an old man, who, on being closely
questioned, said that he had seen the girl leave the gang as
they went to work after dinner. It appeared that she had
been at work during the forenoon, but at dinner-time the
gang was moved, and as it passed through the gully she
slipped out. The driver had not missed her. The overseer
said that when he first took charge of this plantation, the
negroes ran away a great deal—they disliked him so much.
They used to say, ’twas hell to be on his place; but after a
few months they got used to his ways, and liked him better
than any of the rest. He had not had any run away now for
some time. When they ran away they would generally
return within a fortnight. If many of them went off, or if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
they stayed out long, he would make the rest of the force work
Sundays, or deprive them of some of their usual privileges
until the runaways returned. The negroes on the plantation
could always bring them in if they chose to do so. They
depended on them for their food, and they had only to stop
the supplies to oblige them to surrender.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Accepting the position of the overseer, I knew that his
method was right, but it was a red-hot experience to me,
and has ever since been a fearful thing in my memory.
Strangely so, I sometimes think, but I suppose the fact that
the delicate and ingenuous lad who was with me, betrayed not
even the slightest flush of shame, and that I constrained
myself from the least expression of feeling of any kind, made
the impression in my brain the more intense and lasting.</p>

<p>Sitting near a gang with an overseer and the manager,
the former would occasionally call out to one and another by
name, in directing or urging their labour. I asked if he
knew them all by name. He did, but I found that the
manager did not know one in five of them. The overseer
said he generally could call most of the negroes on a plantation
by their names in two weeks after he came to it, but it
was rather difficult to learn them on account of there being
so many of the same name, distinguished from each other by
a prefix. “There’s a Big Jim here, and a Little Jim, and
Eliza’s Jim, and there’s Jim Bob, and Jim Clarisy.”</p>

<p>“What’s Jim Clarisy?—how does he get that name?”</p>

<p>“He’s Clarisy’s child, and Bob is Jim Bob’s father. That
fellow ahead there, with the blue rag on his head, his name
is Swamp; he always goes by that name, but his real name
is Abraham, I believe; is it not, Mr. [Manager]?”</p>

<p>“His name is Swamp on the plantation register—that’s
all I know of him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>“I believe his name is Abraham,” said the overseer; “he
told me so. He was bought of Judge ——, he says, and he
told me his master called him Swamp because he ran away so
much. He is the worst runaway on the place.”</p>

<p>I inquired about the increase of the negroes on the estate,
and the manager having told me the number of deaths and
births the previous year, which gave a net increase of four
per cent.—on Virginia estates it is often twenty per cent.—I
asked if the negroes began to have children at a very early
age. “Sometimes at sixteen,” said the manager. “Yes,
and at fourteen,” said the overseer; “that girl’s had a child”—pointing
to a girl that did not appear older than fourteen.
“Is she married?” “No.” “You see,” said the manager,
“negro girls are not remarkable for chastity; their habits
indeed rather hinder them from having children. They’d
have them younger than they do, if they would marry or live
with but one man, sooner than they do.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> They often do not
have children till they are twenty-five years old.” “Are
those who are married true to each other?” I asked. The
overseer laughed heartily at the idea, and described a disgusting
state of things. Women were almost common property,
though sometimes the men were not all inclined to
acknowledge it; for when I asked: “Do you not try to
discourage this?” the overseer answered: “No, not unless
they quarrel.” “They get jealous and quarrel among themselves
sometimes about it,” the manager explained, “or
come to the overseer and complain, and he has them
punished.” “Give all hands a damned good hiding,” said
the overseer. “You punish for adultery, then, but not for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
fornication?” “Yes,” answered the manager, but “No,”
insisted the overseer, “we punish them for quarrelling; if
they don’t quarrel I don’t mind anything about it, but if it
makes a muss, I give all four of ’em a warning.”</p>

<p>Riding through a large gang of hoers, with two of the
overseers, I observed that a large proportion of them appeared
to be thorough-bred Africans. Both of them thought
that the “real black niggers” were about three-fourths of
the whole number, and that this would hold as an average on
Mississippi and Louisiana plantations. One of them pointed
out a girl—“That one is pure white; you see her hair?”
(It was straight and sandy.) “She is the only one we have
got.” It was not uncommon, he said, to see slaves so white
that they could not be easily distinguished from pure-blooded
whites. He had never been on a plantation before, that had
not more than one on it.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> “Now,” said I, “if that girl
should dress herself well, and run away, would she be suspected
of being a slave?” (I could see nothing myself by
which to distinguish her, as she passed, from an ordinary poor
white girl.)</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; you might not know her if she got to the
North, but any of us would know her.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“By her language and manners.”</p>

<p>“But if she had been brought up as house-servant?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not in that case.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>
<p>The other thought there would be no difficulty; you could
always see a slave girl quail when you looked in her eyes.</p>

<p>I asked if they thought the mulattoes or white slaves were
weaker or less valuable than the pure negroes.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I’d rather have them a great deal,” said one.
“Well, I had not,” said the other; “the blacker the better
for me.” “The white ones,” added the first, “are more
active, and know more, and I think they do the most work.”
“Are they more subject to illness, or do they appear to be of
weaker constitutions?” One said they were not, the other
that they did not seem to bear the heat as well. The first
thought that this might be so, but that, nevertheless, they
would do more work. I afterwards asked the manager’s
opinion. He thought they did not stand excessive heat as
well as the pure negroes, but that, from their greater activity
and willingness, they would do more work. He believed
they were equally strong and no more liable to illness; had
never had reason to think them of weaker constitution. They
often had-large families, and he had not noticed that their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
children were weaker or more subject to disease than others.
He thought that perhaps they did not have so many children
as the pure negroes, but he had supposed the reason to be
that they did not begin bearing so young as the others, and
this was because they were more attractive to the men, and
perhaps more amorous themselves. He knew a great many
mulattoes living together, and they generally had large and
healthy families.</p>

<p>Afterwards, at one of the plantation nurseries, where there
were some twenty or thirty infants and young children, a
number of whom were evidently the offspring of white fathers,
I asked the nurse to point out the healthiest children to me,
and of those she indicated more were of the pure than of the
mixed breed. I then asked her to show me which were the
sickliest, and she did not point to any of the latter. I then
asked if she noticed any difference in this respect between the
black and the yellow children. “Well, dey do say, master,
dat de yellow ones is de sickliest, but I can’t tell for true dat
I ever see as dey was.”</p>

<p>Being with the proprietor and the manager together, I
asked about the religious condition of the slaves. There were
“preachers” on the plantations, and they had some religious
observances on a Sunday; but the preachers were the worst
characters among them, and, they thought, only made their
religion a cloak for habits of especial depravity. They were,
at all events, the most deceitful and dishonest slaves on the
plantation, and oftenest required punishment. The negroes
of all denominations, and even those who ordinarily made no
religious pretensions, would join together in exciting religious
observances. They did not like to have white men preach on
the estate; and in future they did not intend to permit them
to do so. It excited the negroes so much as to greatly interfere
with the subordination and order which were necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
to obtain the profitable use of their labour. They would be
singing and dancing every night in then cabins, till dawn of
day, and utterly unfit themselves for work.</p>

<p>With regard to the religious instruction of slaves, widely
different practices of course prevail. There are some slaveholders,
like Bishop Polk of Louisiana,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> who oblige, and
many others who encourage, their slaves to engage in religious
exercises, furnishing them certain conveniences for the
purpose. Among the wealthier slaveowners, however, and
in all those parts of the country where the enslaved portion
of the population outnumbers the whites, there is generally
a visible, and often an avowed distrust of the effect of
religious exercises upon slaves, and even the preaching of
white clergymen to them is permitted by many with reluctance.
The prevailing impression among us, with regard
to the important influence of slavery in promoting the spread
of religion among the blacks, is an erroneous one in my opinion.
I have heard northern clergymen speak as if they supposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
a regular daily instruction of slaves in the truths of Christianity
to be general. So far is this from being the case, that
although family prayers were held in several of the fifty
planters’ houses in Mississippi and Alabama, in which I passed
a night, I never in a single instance saw a field-hand attend
or join in the devotion of the family.</p>

<p>In South Carolina, a formal remonstrance, signed by over
three hundred and fifty of the leading planters and citizens,
was presented to a Methodist clergyman who had been chosen
by the Conference of that State, as being a cautious and
discreet person, to preach especially to slaves. It was his
purpose, expressly declared beforehand, to confine himself to
verbal instruction in religious truth. “Verbal instruction,”
replied the remonstrants, “will increase the desire of the
black population to learn. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp; Open the missionary sluice,
and the current will swell in its gradual onward advance.
We thus expect <i>a progressive system of improvement</i> will be
introduced, or will follow from the nature and force of circumstances,
which, if not checked (though it may be shrouded
in sophistry and disguise), <i>will ultimately revolutionize our
civil institutions</i>.”</p>

<p>The missionary, the Rev. T. Tupper, accordingly retired
from the field. The local newspaper, the <i>Grenville Mountaineer</i>,
in announcing his withdrawal, stated that the great
body of the people were manifestly opposed to the religious
instruction of their slaves, even if it were only given orally.</p>

<p>Though I do not suppose this view is often avowed, or
consciously held by intelligent citizens, such a formal, distinct,
and effective manifestation of sentiment made by so important
an integral portion of the slaveholding body, cannot be supposed
to represent a merely local or occasional state of mind;
and I have not been able to resist the impression, that even
where the economy, safety, and duty of some sort of religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
education of the slaves is conceded, so much caution, reservation,
and restriction is felt to be necessary in their instruction,
that the result in the majority of cases has been merely to
furnish a delusive clothing of Christian forms and phrases to
the original vague superstition of the African savage.</p>

<p>In the county of Liberty, in Georgia, a Presbyterian
minister has been for many years employed exclusively in
labouring for the moral enlightenment of the slaves, being
engaged and paid for this especial duty by their owners.
From this circumstance, almost unparalleled as it is, it may
be inferred that the planters of that county are, as a body,
remarkably intelligent, liberal, and thoughtful for the moral
welfare of the childlike wards Providence has placed under
their care and tutorship. According to my private information,
there is no body of slaveowners more, if any as
much so, in the United States. I heard them referred to
with admiration of their reputation in this particular, even as
far away as Virginia and Kentucky. I believe, that in no
other district has there been displayed as general and long-continued
an interest in the spiritual well-being of the negroes.
It must be supposed that nowhere else are their circumstances
more happy and favourable to Christian nurture.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>
<p>After labouring thirteen years with a zeal and judgment
which had made him famous, this apostle to the slaves of
Liberty was called to the professorship of theology in the
University of South Carolina. On retiring from his field of
labour as a missionary, he addressed a valedictory sermon to
his patrons, which has been published. While there is no
unbecoming despondency or absence of proper gratitude for
such results as have rewarded his protracted labour, visible in
this document, the summing up is not such as would draw
unusual cheers if given in the report of an African missionary
at the Tabernacle or Exeter Hall. Without a word on which
the most vigilant suspicion could rest a doubt of his entire
loyalty to the uttermost rights of property which might be
claimed by those whom he addressed, he could not avoid
indicating, in the following passages, what he had been
obliged to see to be the insurmountable difficulty in the way
of any vital elevation of character among those to whom he
had been especially charged to preach the Gospel wherewith
Christ blessed mankind:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They [his pastoral charge] are, in the language of Scripture, ‘<i>your
money</i>.’ They are the source, the means of your wealth; by their labour
do you obtain the necessaries, the conveniences, and comforts of life.
The increase of them is the general standard of your worldly prosperity:
without them you would be comparatively poor. <i>They are consequently
sought after and desired as property, and when possessed, must be so taken
care of and managed as to be made profitable.</i></p>

<p>“Now, it is exceedingly difficult to use them as money; to treat them
as property, and at the same time render to them that which is just and
equal as immortal and accountable beings, and as heirs of the grace of life,
equally with ourselves. They are associated in our business, and thoughts,
and feelings, with labour, and interest, and gain, and wealth. Under the
influence of the powerful feeling of self-interest, there is a tendency to
view and to treat them as instruments of labour, as a means of wealth, and
to forget or pass over lightly, the fact that they are what they are, under
the eye and government of God. There is a tendency to rest satisfied
with very small and miserable efforts for their moral improvement, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
give one’s self but little trouble to correct immoralities and reform wicked
practices and habits, should they do their work quietly and profitably, and
enjoy health, and go on to multiply and increase upon the earth.”</p>
</div>

<p>This is addressed to a body of “professing evangelical
Christians,” in a district in which more is done for the
elevation of the slaves than in any other of the South.
What they are called to witness from their own experience, as
the tendency of a system which recognizes slaves as absolute
property, mere instruments of labour and means of wealth,
“exceedingly difficult” for them to resist, is, I am well convinced,
the <i>entirely irresistible effect</i> upon the mass of
slaveholders. Fearing that moral and intellectual culture
may injure their value as property, they oftener interfere to
prevent than they endeavour to assist their slaves from using
the poor opportunities that chance may throw in their way.</p>

<p>Moreover, the missionary adds:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The current of the conversation and of business in society, in respect
to negroes, runs in the channel of interest, and thus increases the blindness
and insensibility of owners. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp; And this custom of society acts also
on the negroes, who, seeing, and more than seeing, <i>feeling and knowing,
that their owners regard and treat them as their money—as property only</i>—are
inclined to lose sight of their better character and higher interests,
and, in their ignorance and depravity, to estimate themselves, and religion,
and virtue, no higher than their owners do.”</p>
</div>

<p>Again, from the paramount interest of owners in the
property quality of these beings, they provide them only such
accommodations for spending the time in which they are not
actively employed, as shall be favourable to their bodily
health, and enable them to comply with the commandment,
to “increase and multiply upon the earth,” without regard
to their moral health, without caring much for their obedience
to the more pure and spiritual commands of the
Scriptures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The consequent mingling up of husbands and wives, children and
youths, banishes the privacy and modesty essential to domestic peace and
purity, and opens wide the door to dishonesty, oppression, violence, and
profligacy. The owner may see, or hear, or know little of it. His servants
may appear cheerful, and go on in the usual way, and enjoy health, and do
his will, yet their actual moral state may be miserable. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp; <i>If family
relations are not preserved and protected, we cannot look for any considerable
degree of moral and religious improvement.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>It must be acknowledged of slavery, as a system, not only
in Liberty county, but as that system finds the expression of
the theory on which it is based in the laws of every Southern
State, that family relations are not preserved and protected
under it. As we should therefore expect, the missionary
finds that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One of the chief causes of the immorality of negroes arises from the
indifference both of themselves and of their owners to family relations.”</p>
</div>

<p>Large planters generally do not allow their negroes to
marry off the plantation to which they belong, conceiving
“that their own convenience and interest, and,” says the
missionary, “the comfort and <i>real</i> happiness of their people”
are thereby promoted. Upon this point, however, it is but
just to quote the views of the editor of the <i>Southern Agriculturist</i>,
who, in urging planters to adopt and strictly maintain
such a regulation, says: “If a master has a servant,
and no suitable one of the other sex for a companion, he
had better give an extra price for such an one as his would
be willing to marry, than to have one man owning the
husband, and the other the wife.”</p>

<p>But this mode of arranging the difficulty seems not to have
occurred to the Liberty county missionary; and while
arguing against the course usually pursued, he puts the
following, as a pertinent suggestion:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Admitting that they are people having their preferences as well as
others, <i>and there be a supply</i>, can that love which is the foundation and
essence of the marriage state be forced?”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>Touching honesty and thrift among the negroes, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“While some discipline their people for every act of theft committed
against their interests, they have no care whatever what amount of pilfering
and stealing the people carry on <i>among themselves</i>. Hence, in some places,
thieves thrive and honest men suffer, until it becomes a practice ‘to keep
if you can what is your own, and get all you can besides that is your
neighbour’s. Things come to such a pass, that the saying of the negroes
is literally true, ‘The people live upon one another.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Referring to the evil of intemperance, it is observed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Whatever toleration masters use towards ardent spirits in others, they
are generally inclined to use none in respect to their servants; and in
effecting this reformation, masters and mistresses should set the example;
for without example, precepts and persuasions are powerless. Nor
can force effect this reformation as surely and perfectly as persuasion—appealing
to the character and happiness of the servant himself, the
appeal recognizes him in such a manner as to produce self-respect, and it
tends to give elevation of conduct and character. I will not dwell upon
this point.”</p>
</div>

<p>He will not dwell on this point; yet, is it not evident that
until this point can be dwelt upon, all effort for the genuine
Christianization of the negro race in the South must be
ineffectual?</p>

<p>The benefit to the African which is supposed to be incidental
to American slavery, is confessedly proportionate to
the degree in which he is forced into intercourse with a
superior race and made subject to its example. Before I
visited the South, I had believed that the advantages accruing
from slavery, in this way, far outweighed the
occasional cruelties, and other evils incidental to the system.
I found, however, the mental and moral condition of the negroes,
even in Virginia, and in those towns and districts containing
the largest proportion of whites, much lower than I had
anticipated; and as soon as I had an opportunity to examine
one of the extensive plantations of the interior, although one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
inherited by its owner, and the home of a large and virtuous
white family, I was satisfied that the advantages arising to
the blacks from association with their white masters were
very inconsiderable, scarcely appreciable, for the great majority
of the field-hands. Even the overseer had barely acquaintance
enough with the slaves, individually, to call them by
name; the owner could not determine if he were addressing
one of his own chattels, or whether it was another man’s
property, he said, when by chance he came upon a negro off
the work. Much less did the slaves have an opportunity to
cultivate their minds by intercourse with other white people.
Whatever of civilization, and of the forms, customs, and shibboleths
of Christianity, they were acquiring by example, and
through police restraints, might, it occurred to me, after all,
but poorly compensate the effect of the systematic withdrawal
from them of all the usual influences which tend to nourish
the moral nature and develope the intellectual faculties, in
savages as well as in civilized free men.</p>

<p>This doubt, as my Northern friends well know, for I had
habitually assumed the opposite, in all previous discussions of
the slavery question, was unexpected and painful to me. I
resisted it long, and it was not till I had been more than
twelve months in the South, with my attention constantly
fixed upon the point, that I ceased to suspect that the circumstances
which brought me to it were exceptional and
deceptive. It grew constantly stronger with every opportunity
I had of observing the condition, habits, and
character of slaves whom I could believe to present fair
examples of the working of the system with the majority of
those subject to it upon the large plantations.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The frequency with which the slaves use religious phrases
of all kinds, the readiness with which they engage in what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
are deemed religious exercises, and fall into religious ecstacies,
with the crazy, jocular manner in which they often talk of
them, are striking and general characteristics. It is not at
all uncommon to hear them refer to conversations which they
allege, and apparently believe themselves to have had with
Christ, the apostles, or the prophets of old, or to account for
some of their actions by attributing them to the direct influence
of the Holy Spirit, or of the devil. It seems to me that
this state of mind is fraught with more danger to their
masters than any to which they could possibly have been
brought by general and systematic education, and by the unrestricted
study of the Bible, even though this involved what
is so much dreaded, but which is, I suspect, an inevitable accompaniment
of moral elevation, the birth of an ambition to
look out for themselves. Grossly ignorant and degraded in
mind, with a crude, undefined, and incomplete system of
theology and ethics, credulous and excitable, intensely superstitious
and fanatical, what better field could a cunning monomaniac
or a sagacious zealot desire in which to set on foot an
appalling crusade?</p>

<p>The African races, compared with the white, at least with
the Teutonic, have greater vanity or love of approbation, a
stronger dramatic and demonstrative character, more excitability,
less exact or analytic minds, and a nature more sensuous,
though (perhaps from want of cultivation) less refined.
They take a real pleasure, for instance, such as it is a rare
thing for a white man to be able to feel, in bright and strongly
contrasting colours, and in music, in which nearly all are
proficient to some extent. They are far less adapted for
steady, uninterrupted labour than we are, but excel us in feats
demanding agility and tempestuous energy. A Mississippi
steamboat manned by negro deck-hands will wood up a third
quicker than one manned by the same number of whites; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
white labourers of equal intelligence and under equal stimulus
will cut twice as much wood, split twice as many rails, and
hoe a third more corn in a day than negroes. On many
plantations, religious exercises are almost the only habitual
recreation not purely sensual, from steady dull labour, in
which the negroes are permitted to indulge, and generally all
other forms of mental enjoyment are discouraged. Religious
exercises are rarely forbidden, and a greater freedom to individual
impulse and talent is allowed while engaged in them
than is ever tolerated in conducting mere amusements or educational
exercises.</p>

<p>Naturally and necessarily all that part of the negro’s
nature which is otherwise suppressed, bursts out with an intensity
and vehemence almost terrible to witness, in forms of
religious worship and communion; and a “profession” of
piety which it is necessary to make before one can take a very
noticeable part in the customary social exercises, is almost
universal, except on plantations where the ordinary tumultuous
religious meetings are discouraged, or in towns where
other recreations are open to the slaves.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Upon the value of the statistics of “coloured church membership,”
which are often used as evidence that the evils of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
slavery are fully compensated by its influence in Christianizing
the slaves, some light is thrown by the following letter
from the white pastor of a town church in that part of the
South in which the whites are most numerous, and in which
the negroes enjoy the most privileges.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“<i>To the Editor of the Richmond (Virginia) Religious Herald.</i></p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp; “The truth is, the teachings of the pulpit (at least among
Baptists) have nothing to do with the matter. Let me furnish a case in
proof. Of two churches which the writer serves, his immediate predecessor
was pastor for about twenty-five years. It would be only necessary to
give his name, to furnish the strongest and most satisfactory assurance
that nothing which ever fell from his lips could be construed into the
support of ignorance, superstition, or fanaticism. During the five or six
years I have served these churches, whatever may have been my errors
and failings (and I am ready to admit that they have been numerous and
grievous enough, in all conscience), I know I have never uttered a sentiment
which could be tortured into the support of the superstitions prevailing
among the coloured people. And yet in both these churches, the
coloured members are as superstitious and fanatical as they are elsewhere.
Indeed, this was to be expected, for I certainly claim no superiority over
my brethren in the ministry, and I am satisfied that many of them are far
better qualified than I am to expose error and to root out superstition.
This state of things, then, is not due to the teachings of the pulpit. Nor
is it the result of private instructions by masters. Indeed, these last have
been afforded so sparingly, till within a few years since, that they could
produce but little effect of any sort. And, besides, those who own servants,
and are willing to teach them, are far too intelligent to countenance
superstition in any way. I repeat the inquiry, then, Why is it that so
many of our coloured members are ignorant, superstitious, and fanatical?
It is the effect of instructions received from leading men among themselves,
and the churches are responsible for this effect, in so far as they
receive into fellowship those who have listened to these instructions,
ground their hopes upon them, and guide their lives by them. Whatever
we may say against superstition, so long as we receive into our churches
those who are its slaves, they will believe that we think them Christians;
and naturally relying on our judgment as expressed by their reception,
they will live deluded, and die but to be lost.</p>

<p>“But some one will say, ‘We never receive coloured persons when they
manifest these superstitions—when they talk of visions, dreams, sounds,’ etc.
This is right as far as it goes. In every such case they should be
rejected. But superstition of a fatal character often exists where nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
is said about dreams and visions. It is just as fatally superstitious to trust
in prayers and feelings, as in dreams and visions. And this is the sort of
superstition which now prevails among the coloured people. They have
found that sights and sounds will not answer before the whites, and now
(reserving these, perhaps, for some chosen auditory of their own colour),
they substitute prayers and feelings. In illustration permit me to record,
in no spirit of levity, the stereotyped experience which generally passes
current, and, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, introduces the coloured
candidate into the church. The pastor is informed, by one of the ‘coloured
deacons,’ that a man wishes to offer to the church with a view to baptism.
The fact is announced, a meeting of the church called, and the candidate
comes forward.</p>

<p>“<i>Pastor.</i>—‘Well, John, tell me in a few words, in your own way, your
religious experience. What have been your feelings, and what are your
present hopes and purposes?’</p>

<p>“<i>John.</i>—‘I see other people trying, and so I thought I would try too, as
I had a soul to save. So I went to pray, and the more I pray the wus I
felt; so I kept on praying, and the more I pray the wus I felt. I felt
heavy—I felt a weight—and I kept on praying till at last I felt light—I
felt easy—I felt like I loved all Christian people—I felt like I loved
everybody,’</p>

<p>“Now this is positively the whole of the experience which is generally
related by coloured candidates for baptism. There may be a slight variation
of expression now and then, but the sense is almost invariably the
same. On this experience, hundreds have been received into the churches—I
I have received many upon it myself. I am somewhat curious to know
how many of the seventy, baptized by my good brother Bagby, told this
tale. I’ll warrant not less than fifty. Have any of us been right in receiving
persons on such a relation as this? In the whole of it, there is
not one word of gospel, not one word about sorrow for sin, not one word
about faith, not one word about Christ. I know that all these things
are subsequently brought out by questions; and were this not the case, I
have no idea that the candidate would be in any instance received. <i>But
that these questions may be understood, they are made necessarily ‘leading
questions,’</i> such as suggest their answers; and consequently these answers
are of comparatively little value. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp; I am aware that, as brother Bagby
suggests, private instructions by masters have been too much neglected.
<i>But these can accomplish but little good, so long as they are counteracted by
the teachings of leading coloured members, in whose views, after all our efforts,
the coloured people will have most confidence.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Not the smallest suggestion, I observe, in all the long
article from which the above is derived, is ventured, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
negroes are capable of education, or that their religious condition
would improve if their general enlightenment of mind
were not studiously prevented.</p>

<p>“I have often heard the remark made,” says the Rev.
C. C. Jones, in a treatise on the “Religious Instruction of
Slaves,” printed at Savannah, Georgia, 1842, “by men
whose standing and office in the churches afforded them
abundant opportunity for observation, that the more they
have had to do with coloured members, the less confidence
they have been compelled to place in their Christian professions.”</p>

<p>A portion of a letter written for publication by the wife of
the pastor of a church in the capital of Alabama, given below,
naïvely reveals the degree of enlightenment prevailing among
the Christianized Africans at a point where their means of instruction
are a thousand times better than they are on an
average throughout the country.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Having talked to him seriously, and in the strongest light held up to
him the enormity of the crime of forsaking his lawful wife and taking
another, Colly replied, most earnestly, and not taking in at all the idea of
guilt, but deeply distressed at having offended his master:</p>

<p>“‘Lor, Massa Harry, what was I to do, sir? She tuk all I could git,
and more too, sir, to put on her back; and tellin’ de truf, sir, dress herself
as no poor man’s wife hav’ any right to. I ’monstrated wid her, massa, but to
no purpose; and den, sir, w’y I jis did all a decent man could do—lef her,
sir, for some oder nigger better off ’an I is.’</p>

<p>“’Twas no use. Colly could not be aroused to conscientiousness on the
subject.</p>

<p>“Not one in a thousand, I suppose, of these poor creatures have any
conception whatever of the sanctity of marriage; nor can they be made
to have; yet, strange to say, they are perfect models of conjugal fidelity
and devotion while the temporary bondage lasts. I have known them to
walk miles after a hard day’s work, not only occasionally, but every night,
to see the old woman, and cut her wood for her, etc. But to see the coolness
with which they throw off the yoke is diverting in the extreme.</p>

<p>“I was accosted one morning in my husband’s study by a respectable-looking
negro woman, who meekly inquired if Mr. B. was at home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>“‘No, he is not. Is it anything particular you want?—perhaps I can
help you.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, ma’am; it’s partickler business wid himself.’</p>

<p>“Having good reason to believe it was the old story of a ‘mountain in
labour and brought forth a mouse,’ I pressed the question, partly to save
my better half some of the petty annoyances to which he was almost daily
subjected by his sable flock, and partly, I own, to gratify a becoming and
laudable curiosity, after all this show of mystery. Behold the answer in
plain English, or rather nigger English.</p>

<p>“‘I came to ask, please ma’am, if I might have another husband.’</p>

<p>“Just at this crisis the oracle entered, who, having authority by a few
spoken words, to join together those whom no man may put asunder, these
poor people simply imagine him gifted with equal power to annul the contract
with a breath of his mouth.</p>

<p>“I was heartily amused to find that this woman was really no widow, as
I had supposed, but merely from caprice, or some reason satisfactory to
herself, no doubt, took it into her head to drop her present spouse and
look out for another. The matter was referred to the ‘Quarterly Conference,’
where an amusing scene occurred, which resulted in the discomfiture
of the disconsolate petitioner, who returned to her home rather
crest-fallen.</p>

<p>“These Quarterly Conference debates, for flights of oratory, and superlativeness
of diction, beggar all description. Be it understood, that negroes,
as a class, have more ‘business’ to attend to than any other people—that
is, provided they can thereby get a chance to ‘speak ’fore white folks.’ To
make a speech is glory enough for Sambo, if he happen to have the ‘gift
of gab;’ and to speak before the preacher is an honour unparalleled. And,
by the way, if the preacher have will and wit enough to manage and
control the discordant elements of a negro Quarterly Conference, he will
be abundantly rewarded with such respect and gratitude as a man seldom
may lay claim to. They account him but a very little ‘lower than the
angels;’ and their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honour, are equally
his at command. But wo be to the unfortunate pastor who treats them
with undue indulgence; they will besiege him daily and hourly with their
petty affairs, and their business meetings will be such a monopoly of his
time and patience, that but for the farcical character of the same, making
them more like dramatic entertainments than sober realities, he would be
in despair. Far into the short hours of morning will they speechify and
magnify, until nothing but the voice of stern authority, in a tone of command
not to be mistaken, can stop the current.”</p>
</div>

<p>An Alabama gentleman whom I questioned with regard to
the chastity of the so-called pious slaves, confessed, that four
negro women had borne children in his own house, all of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
them at the time members in good standing of the Baptist
church, and none of them calling any man husband. The
only negro man in the house was also a church member, and
he believed that he was the father of the four children. He
said that he did not know of more than one negro woman
whom he could suppose to be chaste, yet he knew hosts who
were members of churches.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>A Northern clergyman who had been some years in
another town in Alabama, where also the means of instruction
offered the slaves were unusually good, answered my inquiry,
What proportion of the coloured members of the churches in
the town had any clear comprehension of the meaning of the
articles of faith which they professed? “Certainly not more
than one in seven.”</p>

<p>The acknowledgment that “the coloured people will, in
spite of all our efforts, have more confidence in the views of
leading coloured members,” made by the writer of the letter
taken from the “Religious Herald,” has been generally made
by all clergymen at the South with whom I have conversed.
A clergyman of the Episcopal Church, of very frank and
engaging manners, said in my presence that he had been
striving for seven years to gain the confidence of the small
number of Africans belonging to his congregation, and with
extreme humility he had been lately forced to acknowledge
that all his apparent success hitherto had been most delusive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
When asked how he accounted for it, he at once ascribed it
to the negro’s habitual distrust of the white race, and in
discussing the causes of this distrust he asked how, if he pretended
to believe that the Bible was the Word of God,
addressed equally to all the human race, he could explain to
a negro’s satisfaction why he should fear to put it directly
into his hands and instruct him to read it and judge for himself
of his duty? A planter present, a member of his church,
immediately observed that these were dangerous views, and
advised him to be cautious in the expression of them. The
laws of the country forbade the education of negroes, and the
church laws, and he trusted always would remain, the bulwark
of the laws. The clergyman replied that he had no design
to break the laws, but he must say that he considered that
the law which withheld the Bible from the negro was unnecessary
and papistical in character.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The “Methodist Protestant,” a religious newspaper
edited by a clergyman, in Maryland, where the slave population
is to the free only in the ratio of one to twenty-five,
lately printed an account of a slave auction in Java (translated
from a Dutch paper), at which the father of a slave
family was permitted to purchase his wife and children at a
nominal price, owing to the humanity of the spectators. The
account concluded as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It would be difficult to describe the joy experienced by these slaves
on hearing the fall of the hammer which thus gave them their liberty;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
and this joy was further augmented by the presents given them by numbers
of the spectators, in order that they might be able to obtain a subsistence
till such time as they could procure employment.</p>

<p>“These are the acts of a noble generosity that deserves to be remembered,
and which, at the same time, testify that the inhabitants of Java
begin to abhor the crying injustice of slavery, and are willing to entertain
measures for its abolition.”</p>
</div>

<p>To give currency to such ideas, even in Maryland, would
be fatal to what ministers call their “influence,” and which
they everywhere value at a rather dangerous estimate; accordingly,
in the editorial columns prominence is given to the
following salve to the outraged sensibilities of the subscribers:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“SLAVE AUCTION IN JAVA.</p>

<p>“A brief article, with this head, appears on the fourth page of our paper
this week. It is of a class of articles we <i>never select</i>, because they are very
often manufactured by paragraphists for a purpose, and are not reliable.
It was put in by our printer in place of something we had <i>marked out</i>.
We did not see this objectionable substitute until the outside form was
worked off, and are therefore not responsible for it.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The habitual caution imposed on clergymen and public
teachers must, and obviously does have an important secondary
effect, similar to that usually attributed by Protestants to
papacy, upon the minds of all the people, discountenancing
and retarding the free and fearless exercise of the mind upon
subjects of a religious or ethical nature, and the necessity of
accepting and apologizing for the exceedingly low morality of
the nominally religious slaves, together with the familiarity
with this immorality which all classes acquire, renders the
existence of a very elevated standard of morals among the
whites almost an impossibility.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>In spite of the constant denunciations by the Southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
newspapers, of those who continued to patronize Northern
educational institutions, I never conversed with a cultivated
Southerner on the effects of slavery, that he did not express a
wish or intention to have his own children educated where
they should be free from demoralizing association with slaves.
That this association is almost inevitably corrupting and
dangerous, is very generally (I may say, excepting by the
extremest fanatics of South Carolina, universally) admitted.
Now, although the children of a few wealthy men may, for
a limited period, be preserved from this danger, the children
of the million cannot be. Indeed it requires a man of some
culture, and knowledge of the rest of the world, to appreciate
the danger sufficiently to guard at all diligently against it.
If habitual intercourse with a hopelessly low and immoral
class is at all bad in its effects on young minds, the people
of the South are, as a people, educated subject to this bad
influence, and must bear the consequences. In other words,
if the slaves must not be elevated, it would seem to be a
necessity that the citizens should steadily degenerate.</p>

<p>Change and grow more marked in their peculiarities with
every generation, they certainly do, very obviously. “The
South” has a traditional reputation for qualities and habits in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
which I think the Southern people, as a whole, are to-day
more deficient than any other nation in the world. The
Southern gentleman, as we ordinarily conceive him to be, is
as rare a phenomenon in the South at the present day as is
the old squire of Geoffry Crayon in modern England. But
it is unnecessary to argue how great must be the influence,
upon people of a higher origin, of habitual association with
a race systematically kept at the lowest ebb of intellect and
morals. It has been elaborately and convincingly described
by Mr. Jefferson, from his personal experience and observation
of his neighbours. What he testified to be the effect upon
the Virginians, in his day, of owning and associating with
slaves, is now to be witnessed to a far greater and more
deplorable extent throughout the whole South, but most
deplorably in districts where the slave population predominates,
and where, consequently, the action of slavery has been
most unimpeded.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>
<p>What proportion of the larger cotton plantations are
resided upon by their owners, I am unable to estimate with
confidence. Of those having cabin accommodations for fifty
slaves each, which came under my observation from the road,
while I was travelling through the rich cotton district bordering
the Mississippi river, I think more than half were unprovided
with a habitation which I could suppose to be the
ordinary residence of a man of moderate wealth. I should
judge that a large majority of all the slaves in this district,
were left by their owners to the nearly unlimited government
of hireling overseers the greater part of the time. Some of
these plantations are owned by capitalists, who reside permanently
and constantly in the North or in Europe. Many
are owned by wealthy Virginians and Carolinians, who reside
on the “show plantations” of those States—country seats,
the exhausted soil of which will scarcely produce sufficient
to feed and clothe the resident slaves, whose increase is
constantly removed to colonize these richer fields of the
West.</p>

<p>A still larger number are merely occasional sojourning
places of their owners, who naturally enough prefer to live,
as soon as they can afford to do so, where the conveniences
and luxuries belonging to a highly civilized state of society
are more easily obtained than they can ever be in a country
of large plantations. It is rare that a plantation of this class
can have a dozen intelligent families residing within a day’s
ride of it. Any society that a planter enjoys on his estate
must, therefore, consist in a great degree of permanent
guests. Hence the name for hospitality of wealthy planters.
A large plantation is necessarily a retreat from general
society, and is used by its owner, I am inclined to think, in
the majority of cases, in winter, as Berkshire villas and farms
are in summer by rich people of New York and Boston. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
have never been on a plantation numbering fifty field-hands,
the owner of which was accustomed to reside steadily through
the year upon it. Still I am aware that there are many such,
and possibly it is a minority of them who are regularly absent
with their families from their plantations during any considerable
part of the year.</p>

<p>The summer visitors to our Northern watering places,
and the European tourists, from the South, are, I judge,
chiefly of the migratory, wealthy class. Such persons, it is
evident are much less influenced in their character and
habits, by association with slaves, than any other at the
South.</p>

<p>The number of the very wealthy is, of course, small, yet
as the chief part of the wealth of these consists in slaves, no
inconsiderable proportion of all the slaves belong to men who
deputize their government in a great measure to overseers.
It may be computed, from the census of 1850, that about one
half the slaves of Louisiana and one third that of Mississippi,
belong to estates of not less than fifty slaves each, and of
these, I believe, nine-tenths live on plantations which their
owners reside upon, if at all, but transiently.</p>

<p>The number of plantations of this class, and the proportion
of those employed upon them to the whole body of
negroes in the country, is as I have said, rapidly increasing.
At the present prices of cotton the large grower has such advantages
over the small, that the owner of a plantation of
fifty slaves, favourably situated, unless he lives very recklessly,
will increase in wealth so rapidly and possess such
a credit that he may very soon establish or purchase other
plantations, so that at his death his children may be provided
for without reducing the effective force of negroes on any division
of his landed estate. The excessive credit given to such
planters by negro dealers and tradesmen renders this the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
more practicable. The higher the price of cotton the higher
is that of negroes, and the higher the price of negroes the
less is it in the power of men of small capital to buy them.
Large plantations of course pay a much larger per centage
on the capital invested in them than smaller ones; indeed
the only plausible economical defence of slavery is simply
an explanation of the advantages of associated labour, advantages
which are possessed equally by large manufacturing
establishments in which free labourers are brought together
and employed in the most effective manner, and which I
can see no sufficient reason for supposing could not be made
available for agriculture did not the good results flowing
from small holdings, on the whole, counterbalance them.
If the present high price of cotton and the present scarcity
of labour at the South continues, the cultivation of cotton
on small plantations will by-and-by become unusual, for the
same reason that hand-loom weaving has become unusual in
the farm houses of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>But whatever advantages large plantations have, they
accrue only to their owners and to the buyers of cotton; the
mass of the white inhabitants are dispersed over a greater
surface, discouraged and driven toward barbarism by them,
and the blacks upon them, while rapidly degenerating from
all that is redeeming in savage-life, are, it is to be feared,
gaining little that is valuable of civilization.</p>

<p>In the report of the Grand Jury of Richland District,
South Carolina, in eighteen hundred and fifty-four, calling
for a re-establishment of the African slave trade,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> it is
observed: “As to the moralty of this question, it is scarcely
necessary for us to allude to it; when the fact is remarked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
that the plantations of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and
Texas have been and are daily settled by the removal of
slaves from the more northern of the Slave States, and that
in consequence of their having been raised in a more healthy
climate and in most cases trained to pursuits totally different,
the mortality even on the best-ordered farms is so great that
in many instances the entire income is expended in the
purchase of more slaves from the same source in order to
replenish and keep up those plantations, while in <i>every case</i>
the condition of the slave, if his life is spared, is made worse
both physically and morally. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp; And if you look at the
subject in a religious point of view, the contrast is equally
striking, for when you remove a slave from the more northern
to the more southern parts of the slaveholding States, you
thereby diminish his religious opportunities.”</p>

<p>I believe that this statement gives an exaggerated and
calumnious report of the general condition of the slaves upon
the plantations of the States referred to—containing, as they
do, nearly one half of the whole slave population of the South—but
I have not been able to resist the conviction that in
the districts where cotton is now grown most profitable to
the planters, the oppression and deterioration of the negro
race is much more lamentable than is generally supposed
by those who like myself have been constrained, by other considerations,
to accept it as a duty to oppose temperately but
determinately the modern policy of the South, of which this
is an immediate result. Its effect on the white race, I still
consider to be infinitely more deplorable.</p>

<span class="s08">SLAVERY AS A POOR-LAW SYSTEM.</span></h2>

<p>In the year 1846 the Secretary of the Treasury of the
United States addressed a circular of inquiries to persons

information of the national resources. In reply to this

—
In the report of an Agricultural Society, the work of one
hand, on a well-regulated sugar-estate, is put down at the
cultivation of five acres—producing 5,000 pounds of sugar,
and 125 gallons of molasses; the former valued on the spot
at 5½ cents per pound, and the latter at 18 cents per gallon—together,
$297.50. The annual expenses, per hand, including
wages paid, horses, mules, and oxen, physician’s bills,
etc., $105. An estate of eighty negroes annually costs
$8,330. The items are as follows—Salt meat and spirits,
$830; clothing, $1,200; medical attendance and medicines,
$400; Indian corn, $1,090 (total for food and drink
of negroes, and other live stock, $24 per head of the negroes,
per annum. For clothing $15); overseer and sugar-maker’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
salary, $1,000; taxes $300. The capital invested in 1,200
acres of land, with its stock of slaves, horses, mules, and
working oxen, is estimated at $147,200. One-third, or 400
acres, being cultivated annually in cane, it is estimated, will
yield 400,000 pounds, at 5½ cents, and 10,000 gallons
molasses at 18 cents—together $23,800. Deduct annual
expense, as before, $8,330, an apparent profit remains of
$15,470 or 10 3-7 per cent. interest on the investment.
The crop upon which these estimates were based, has been
considered an uncommonly fine one.</p>

<p>These estimates are all made by persons anxious to maintain
the necessity of protection to the continued production of sugar
in the United States, and who are, therefore, under strong
temptation to over-estimate expenditures.</p>

<p>In the first statement, the cost of clothing and boarding a
first-rate, hard-working man is stated to be $30 a year. A
suit of winter clothing and a pair of trousers for summer, a
blanket for bedding, a pair of shoes and a hat, must all at
least be included under the head of clothing; and these,
however poor, could not certainly cost, altogether, less than
$10. For food, then, $20 a year is a large estimate, which
is 5½ cents. a day. This is for the best hands; light hands
are estimated at half this cost. Does the food of a first-rate
labourer, anywhere in the free world, cost less? The lowest
price paid by agricultural labourers in the Free States of
America for board is 21 cents a day, that is, $1.50 a week;
the larger part probably pay at least twice as much as this.</p>

<p>On most plantations, I suppose, but by no means on all, the
slaves cultivate “patches,” and raise poultry for themselves.
The produce is nearly always sold to get money to buy tobacco
and Sunday finery. But these additions to the usual
allowance cannot be said to be provided for them by their
masters. The labour expended in this way for themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
does not average half a day a week per slave; and many
planters will not allow their slaves to cultivate patches, because
it tempts them to reserve for and to expend in the
night-work the strength they want employed in their service
during the day, and also because the produce thus obtained is
made to cover much plundering of their master’s crops, and
of his live stock.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The free labourer also, in addition to his
board, nearly always spends something for luxuries—tobacco,
fruit, and confections, to say nothing of dress and luxuries
and recreations.</p>

<p>The fact is, that ninety-nine in a hundred of our free
labourers, from choice and not from necessity—for the same
provisions cost more in Louisiana than they do anywhere in
the Northern States—live, in respect to food, at least four
times as well as the average of the hardest-worked slaves on
the Louisiana sugar-plantations. And for two or three months
in the year I have elsewhere shown that these are worked
with much greater severity than free labourers at the North
ever are. For on no farm, and in no factory, or mine, even
when double wages are paid for night-work, did I ever hear
of men or women working regularly eighteen hours a day.
If ever done, it is only when some accident makes it especially
desirable for a few days.</p>

<p>I have not compared the comfort of the light hands, in
which, besides the aged and children, are evidently included<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
most of the females of the plantation, with that of factory
girls and apprentices; but who of those at the North was
ever expected to find board at four cents a day, and obliged to
save money enough out of such an allowance to provide him
or herself with clothing? But that, manifestly and beyond
the smallest doubt of error (except in favour of free labour),
expresses the condition of the Louisiana slave. Forty-eight
of the most worthy planters of the State attest it in an official
document, published by order of Congress.</p>

<p>There is no reason for supposing that the slaves are much,
if any, better fed elsewhere than in Louisiana. I was expressly
told in Virginia that I should find them better fed in
Louisiana than anywhere else. In the same Report of Mr.
Secretary Walker, a gentleman in South Carolina testifies
that he considers that the “furnishing” (food and clothing)
of “full-tasked hands” costs $15 a year.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The United States army is generally recruited from our
labouring class, and a well-conditioned and respectable
labourer is not very often induced to join it. The following,
taken from an advertisement, for recruits, in the <i>Richmond
Enquirer</i>, shows the food provided:</p>

<p>“<i>Daily Rations.</i>—One and a quarter pounds of beef, one
and three-sixteenths pounds of bread; and at the rate of
eight quarts of beans, eight pounds of sugar, four pounds of
coffee, two quarts of salt, four pounds of candles, and four
pounds of soap, to every hundred rations.”</p>

<p>From an advertisement for slaves to be hired by the year,
to work on a canal, in the <i>Daily Georgian</i>:</p>

<p>“<i>Weekly Allowance.</i>—They will be provided with three
and a half pounds of pork or bacon, and ten quarts of gourd
seed corn per week, lodged in comfortable shanties, and
attended by a skilful physician.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>
<p>The expense of boarding, clothes, taxes, and so forth, of a
male slave, is estimated by Robert C. Hall, a Maryland
planter, at $45 per annum; this in a climate but little
milder than that of New York, and in a breeding state. By
J. D. Messenger, Jerusalem, Virginia: “The usual estimate
for an able-bodied labourer—three barrels of corn, and 250
pounds of well-cured bacon, seldom using beef or pork; peas
and potatoes substitute about one-third the allowance of
bread” (maize). By R. G. Morris, Amherst County, Va.:
“Not much beef is used on our estates; bacon, however, is
used much more freely, three pounds a week being the usual
allowance. The quantity of milk used by slaves is frequently
considerable.”-<i>Pat. Office Report</i>, 1848.</p>

<p>On the most valuable plantation, with one exception,
which I visited in the South, no meat was regularly provided
for the slaves, but a meal of bacon was given them “occasionally.”</p>

<p>Louisiana is the only State in which meat is required, by
law, to be furnished the slaves. I believe the required ration
is four pounds a week, with a barrel of corn (flour barrel of
ears of maize) per month, and salt. (This law is a dead
letter, many planters in the State making no regular provision
of meat for their force.) In North Carolina the law
fixes “a quart of corn per day” as the proper allowance of
food for a slave. In no other States does the law define the
quantity, but it is required, in general terms, to be sufficient
for the health of the slave; and I have no doubt that suffering
from want of food is rare. The food is everywhere,
however, coarse, crude, and wanting in variety; much more
so than that of our prison convicts.</p>

<p>Does argument, that the condition of free-labourers is, on
the whole, better than that of slaves, or that simply they are
generally better fed, and more comfortably provided, seem to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
any one to be unnecessary? Many of our newspapers, of the
largest circulation, and certainly of great influence among
people—probably not very reflective, but certainly not fools—take
the contrary for granted, whenever it suits their purpose.
The Southern newspapers, so far as I know, do so, without
exception. And very few Southern writers, on any subject
whatever, can get through a book, or even a business or
friendly letter, to be sent North, without, in some form or
other, asserting that Northern labourers might well envy the
condition of the slaves. A great many Southern gentlemen—gentlemen
whom I respect much for their moral character, if
not for their faculties of observation—have asserted it so
strongly and confidently, as to shut my mouth, and by
assuring me that they had personally observed the condition
of Northern labourers themselves, and really knew that I was
wrong, have for a time half convinced me against my long
experience. I have, since my return, received letters to the
same effect: I have heard the assertion repeated by several
travellers, and even by Northerners, who had resided long in
the South: I have heard it publicly repeated in Tammany
Hall, and elsewhere, by Northern Democrats: I have seen it
in European books and journals: I have, in times past, taken
its truth for granted, and repeated it myself. Such is the
effect of the continued iteration of falsehood.</p>

<p>Since my return I have made it a subject of careful and
extended inquiry. I have received reliable and unprejudiced
information in the matter, or have examined personally the
food, the wages, and the habits of the labourers in more than
one hundred different farmers’ families, in every Free State
(except California), and in Canada. I have made personal
observations and inquiries of the same sort in Great Britain,
Germany, France, and Belgium. In Europe, where there are
large landed estates, which are rented by lordly proprietors to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
the peasant farmers, or where land is divided into such small
portions that its owners are unable to make use of the best
modern labour-saving implements, the condition of the
labourer, as respects food, often is as bad as that of the slave
often is—never worse than that sometimes is. But in general,
even in France, I do not believe it is generally or frequently
worse; I believe it is, in the large majority of cases,
much better than that of the majority of slaves. And as
respects higher things than the necessities of life—in their
intellectual, moral, and social condition, with some exceptions
on large farms and large estates in England, bad as is that
of the mass of European labourers, the man is a brute or a
devil who, with my information, would prefer that of the
American slave. As to our own labourers, in the Free
States, I have already said enough for my present purpose.</p>

<p>But it is time to speak of the extreme cases, of which so
much use has been made, in the process of destroying the
confidence of the people of the United States in the freedom
of trade, as applied to labour.</p>

<p>In the year 1855, the severest winter ever known occurred
at New York, in conjunction with unprecedentedly high
prices of food and fuel, extraordinary business depression,
unparalleled marine disasters, and the failure of establishments
employing large numbers of men and women. At the same
time, there continued to arrive, daily, from five hundred to
one thousand of the poorer class of European peasantry.
Many of these came, expecting to find the usual demand and
the usual reward for labour, and were quite unprepared to
support themselves for any length of time unless they could
obtain work and wages. There was consequently great
distress.</p>

<p>We all did what we thought we could, or ought, to relieve
it; and with such success, that not one single case of actual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
starvation is known to have occurred in a close compacted
population of over a million, of which it was generally reported
fifty thousand were out of employment. Those who
needed charitable assistance were, in nearly every case, recent
foreign immigrants, sickly people, cripples, drunkards, or
knaves taking advantage of the public benevolence, to neglect
to provide for themselves. Most of those who received
assistance would have thrown a slave’s ordinary allowance
in the face of the giver, as an insult; and this often occurred
with more palatable and suitable provisions. Hundreds and
hundreds, to my personal knowledge, during the worst of this
dreadful season, refused to work for money-wages that would
have purchased them ten times the slave’s ordinary allowance
of the slave’s ordinary food. In repeated instances, men who
represented themselves to be suffering for food refused to
work for a dollar a day. A labourer, employed by a neighbour
of mine, on wages and board, refused to work unless he
was better fed. “What’s the matter,” said my neighbour;
“don’t you have enough?” “Enough; yes, such as it is.”
“You have good meat, good bread, and a variety of vegetables;
what do you want else?” “Why, I want pies and
puddings, too, to be sure.” Another labourer left another
neighbour of mine, because, as he alleged, he never had any
meat offered him except beef and pork; he “didn’t see why
he shouldn’t have chickens.”</p>

<p>And these men went to New York, and joined themselves
to that army on which our Southern friends exercise their
pity—of labourers out of work—of men who are supposed to
envy the condition of the slave, because the “slave never dies
for want of food.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>
<p>In the depth of winter, a trustworthy man wrote us from
Indiana:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Here, at Rensselaer, a good mechanic, a joiner or shoemaker, for
instance—and numbers are needed here—may obtain for his labour in
one week:</p>

<ul class="none">
<li> 2 bushels of corn.</li>
<li> 1 bushel of wheat.</li>
<li> 5 pounds of sugar.</li>
<li> ½ pound of tea.</li>
<li>10 pounds of beef.</li>
<li>25 pounds of pork.</li>
<li> 1 good turkey.</li>
<li> 3 pounds of butter.</li>
<li> 1 pound of coffee.</li>
<li> 1 bushel of potatoes.</li>
</ul>

<p>and have a couple of dollars left in his pocket, to start with the next
Monday morning.”</p>
</div>

<p>The moment the ice thawed in the spring, the demand for
mechanics exceeded the supply, and the workmen had the
master-hand of the capitalists. In June, the following rates
were willingly paid to the different classes of workmen—some
of the trades being on strike for higher:—</p>

<p>At this time I engaged a gardener, who had been boarding
for a month or two in New York, and paying for his board
and lodging $3 a week. I saw him at the dinner-table of
his boarding house, and I knew that the table was better
supplied with a variety of wholesome food, and was more
attractive, than that of the majority of slaveowners with

<p>This shows that in 1836 it required the labour of thirty-four
and a half days to pay for the commodities mentioned;
while in 1840 it required only the labour of twenty-nine days,
and in 1843 that of only twenty-three and a half days to pay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
for the same. If we compare the ordinary allowance of food
given to slaves per month—as, for instance, sixteen pounds
pork, one bushel corn meal, and, say one quart of molasses
on an average, and a half pint of salt—with that which it
is shown by this table the free labourer is usually able to
obtain by a month’s labour, we can estimate the comparative
general comfort of each.</p>

<p>I am not all disposed to neglect the allegation that there
is sometimes great suffering among our free labourers. Our
system is by no means perfect; no one thinks it so: no one
objects to its imperfections being pointed out. There was no
subject so much discussed in New York that winter as the
causes, political and social, which rendered us liable to have
labourers, under the worst possible combination of circumstances,
liable to difficulty in procuring satisfactory food.</p>

<p>But this difficulty, as a serious thing, is a very rare and
exceptional one (I speak of the whole of the Free States):
that it is so, and that our labourers are ordinarily better fed
and clothed than the slaves, is evident from their demands
and expectations, when they are deemed to be suffering.
When any real suffering does occur, it is mainly a consequence
and a punishment of their own carelessness and improvidence,
and is in the nature of a remedy.</p>

<p>And in every respect, for the labourer, the competitive
system, in its present lawless and uncertain state, is far
preferable to the slave system; and any labourer, even if he
were a mere sensualist and materialist, would be a fool to
wish himself a slave.</p>

<p>One New York newspaper, having a very large circulation
at the South, but a still larger at the North, in discussing
this matter, last winter, fearlessly and distinctly declared—as
if its readers were expected to accept the truth of the assertion
at once, and without argument—that the only sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
prevention of destitution among a labouring class was to be
found in slavery; that there was always an abundance of food
in the Slave States, and hinted that it might yet be necessary,
as a security against famine, to extend slavery over the present
Free States. This article is still being copied by the
Southern papers, as testimony of an unwilling witness to the
benevolence and necessity of the eternal slavery of working
people.</p>

<p>The extracts following, from Southern papers, will show
what has occurred in the slave country in the meanwhile:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For several weeks past, we have noticed accounts of distress among
the poor in some sections of the South, for the want of bread, particularly
in Western Georgia, East and Middle Alabama. Over in Coosa, corn-cribs
are lifted nightly; and one poor fellow (corn thief) lately got caught
between the logs, and killed! It is said there are many grain-hoarders in
the destitute regions, awaiting higher prices! The L—d pity the poor,
for his brother man will not have any mercy upon his brother.”—<i>Pickens
Republican, Carrolton, Ala., June 5, 1855.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We regret that we are unable to publish the letter of Governor Winston,
accompanied by a memorial to him from the citizens of a portion of
Randolph county, showing a great destitution of breadstuffs in that section,
and calling loudly for relief.</p>

<p>“The Claiborne <i>Southerner</i> says, also, that great destitution in regard
to provisions of all kinds, especially corn, prevails in some portions of
Perry county.”—<i>Sunny South, Jacksonville, Ala., May 26, 1855.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As for wheat, the yield in Talladega, Tallapoosa, Chambers, and Macon,
is better even than was anticipated. Flour is still high, but a fortnight
will lower the price very materially. We think that wheat is bound
to go down to $1.25 to $1.50 per bushel, though a fine article commands
now $2.25.</p>

<p>“Having escaped famine—as we hope we have—we trust the planting
community of Alabama will never again suffer themselves to be brought
so closely in view of it. Their want of thrift and foresight has come
remarkably near placing the whole country in an awful condition. It is
only to a kind Providence that we owe a deliverance from a great calamity,
which would have been clearly the result of man’s short-sightedness.”—<i>Montgomery
Mail, copied in Savannah Georgian, June 25, 1855.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Wheat crops, however, are coming in good, above an average; but
oats are entirely cut off. I am issuing commissary, this week for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
county, to distribute some corn bought by the Commissioner’s Court, for
the destitute of our county; and could you have witnessed the applicants,
and heard their stories, for the last few days, I am satisfied you could
draw a picture that would excite the sympathy of the most selfish heart.
I am free to confess that I had no idea of the destitution that prevails in
this county. Why, sir, what do you think of a widow and her children
living, for three days and nights, on boiled weeds, called pepper grass?—yet
such, I am credibly informed, has been the case in Chambers County.”—<i>From
a letter to the editor of the Montgomery (Ala.) Journal, from Hon.
Samuel Pearson, Judge of Probate, for Chambers County, Alabama.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Famine in Upper Georgia.</span>—We have sad news from the north part
of Georgia. The <i>Dalton Times</i> says that many people are without corn,
or means to procure any. And, besides, there is none for sale. In some
neighbourhoods, a bushel could not be obtained for love or money. Poor
men are offering to work for a peck of corn a day. If they plead, Our
children will starve,’ they are answered, ‘So will mine, if I part with the
little I have.’ Horses and mules are turned out into the woods, to wait
for grass, or starve. The consequence is, that those who have land can
only plant what they can with the hoe—they cannot plough. It is seriously
argued that, unless assisted soon, many of the poor class of that
section will perish.”—<i>California Paper.</i><a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>
</div>

<p>No approach to anything like such a state of things as
those extracts portray (which extended over parts of three
agricultural States) ever occurred, I am sure, in any rural
district of the Free States. Even in our most thickly-peopled
manufacturing districts, to which the staple articles
of food are brought from far-distant regions, assistance from
abroad, to sustain the poor, has never been asked; nor do I
believe the poor have ever been reduced, for weeks together,
to a diet of corn. But this famine at the South occurred in
a region where most productive land can be purchased for
from three to seven dollars an acre; where maize and wheat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
grow kindly; where cattle, sheep, and hogs, may be pastured
over thousands of acres, at no rent; where fuel has no value,
and at a season of the year when clothing or shelter is hardly
necessary to comfort.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that this frightful famine, unprecedented
in North America, was scarcely noticed, in the
smallest way, by any of those Southern papers which, in the
ordinary course of things, ever reach the North. In the
Charleston, Savannah, and Mobile papers, received at our
commercial reading-rooms, I have not been able to find any
mention of it at all—a single, short, second-hand paragraph
in a market report excepted. But these journals had columns
of reports from our papers, and from their private correspondents,
as well as pages of comment, on the distress of
the labourers in New York City the preceding winter.</p>

<p>In 1837, the year of repudiation in Mississippi, a New
Orleans editor describes the effect of the money-pressure upon
the planters, as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They are now left without provisions, and the means of living and
using their industry for the present year. In this dilemma, planters,
whose crops have been from 100 to 700 bales, find themselves forced to
sacrifice many of their slaves, in order to get the common necessaries of
life, for the support of themselves and the rest of their negroes. In many
places, heavy planters compel their slaves to fish for the means of subsistence,
rather than sell them at such ruinous rates. There are, at this
moment, thousands of slaves in Mississippi, that know not where the next
morsel is to come from. The master must be ruined, to save the wretches
from being starved.”</p>
</div>

<p>Absolute starvation is as rare, probably, in slavery, as in
freedom; but I do not believe it is more so. An instance is
just recorded in the <i>New Orleans Delta</i>. Other papers
omit to notice it—as they usually do facts which it may be
feared will do discredit to slavery—and even the <i>Delta</i>, as
will be seen, is anxious that the responsibility of the publication
should be fixed upon the coroner:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Inquest.—Death from neglect and starvation.</span>—The body of an old
negro, named Bob, belonging to Mr. S. B. Davis, was found lying dead in
the woods, near Marigny Canal, on the Gentilly Road, yesterday. The
coroner held an inquest; and, after hearing the evidence, the jury returned
a verdict of ‘Death from starvation and exposure, through neglect
of his master.’ It appeared from the evidence that the negro was too old
to work any more, being nearly seventy; and so they drove him forth into
the woods to die. He had been without food for forty-eight hours, when
found by Mr. Wilbank, who lives near the place, and who brought him
into his premises on a wheelbarrow, gave him something to eat, and endeavoured
to revive his failing energies, which had been exhausted from exposure
and want of food. Every effort to save his life, however, was unavailing,
and he died shortly after being brought to Mr. Wilbank’s. The
above statement we publish, as it was furnished us by the coroner.”—<i>Sept.
18, 1855.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This is the truth, then—is it not?—The slaves are generally
sufficiently well-fed to be in tolerable working condition;
but not as well as our free labourers generally are: slavery,
in practice, affords no safety against occasional suffering for
want of food among labourers, or even against their starvation
any more than the competitive system; while it withholds
all encouragement from the labourer to improve his faculties
and his skill; destroys his self-respect; misdirects and debases
his ambition, and withholds all the natural motives
which lead men to endeavour to increase their capacity of
usefulness to their country and the world. To all this, the
<i>occasional suffering</i> of the free labourer is favourable, on the
whole. The occasional suffering of the slave has no such
advantage. To deceit, indolence, malevolence, and thievery,
it may lead, as may the suffering—though it is much less
likely to—of the free labourer; but to industry, cultivation of
skill, perseverance, economy, and virtuous habits, neither the
suffering, nor the dread of it as a possibility, ever can lead
the slave, as it generally does the free labourer, unless it is by
inducing him to run away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br>
<span class="s08">COTTON SUPPLY AND WHITE LABOUR IN THE COTTON CLIMATE.</span></h2>

<p>Mr. Russell,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> although he clearly sees the calamity of the
South, fully accepts the cotton planter’s opinion, that, after all,
the system of slavery is a necessary evil attending upon the
great good of cheap cotton. He says: “If the climate had
admitted of the growing of cotton on the banks of the Ohio,
we should have seen that slavery possessed as great advantages
over free labour in the raising of this crop as it does in that of
tobacco.” If this is so, it is important that it should be well
understood why it is so as precisely as possible.</p>

<p>In his Notes on Maryland, Mr. Russell (p. 141) says:
“Though a slave may, under very favourable circumstances,
cultivate twenty acres of wheat and twenty acres of Indian
corn, he cannot manage more than two acres of tobacco. The
cultivation of tobacco, therefore, admits of the concentration of
labour, and thus the superintendence and management of a
tobacco plantation will be more perfect and less expensive than
a corn one.” And this is the only explanation he offers of the
supposed advantage of slave labour in the cultivation of tobacco
(and of consequence in the cultivation of cotton). The
chief expense of raising Indian corn is chargeable to planting
and tillage, that of tobacco to the seedbed, the transplanting
and nursing of the young plants (which is precisely similar
to the same operation with cabbages), the hand-weeding, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
hoeing after the plant has “become too large to work without
injuring the leaves by the swingle-trees of a horse plough;”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
“the topping,” “the suckering,” the selection and removal of
valueless leaves, and “the worming,” all of them, except
hoeing, being operations which can be performed by children
and child-bearing women, as they usually are in Virginia.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The chief expense of raising cotton, as of Indian corn, is
that of planting and tillage. The principal difference between
the method of tillage of cotton and that of Indian corn is
occasioned by the greater luxuriance of weeds in the Southern
climate and the slow growth of the cotton plant in its early
stages, which obliges the tillage process to be more carefully
and more frequently performed. For this reason, the area of
cotton cultivated by each labourer is less than of corn. The
area of corn land to a hand is much over-estimated by Mr.
Russell. On the other hand, the only mention he makes of
the area of cotton land to a hand (being the statement of a
negro) would lead to the conclusion that it is often not over three
acres, and that five acres is extraordinary. Mr. De Bow says,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
in an argument to prove that the average production per acre
is over-estimated, “In the real cotton region, perhaps the
average number of acres per hand is ten.”</p>

<p>Mr. Russell observes of worming and leafing tobacco:
“These operations can be done as well, and consequently as
cheaply, by women and children as by full-grown men.”
(Page 142.) After reading Mr. Russell’s views, I placed
myself, through the kindness of Governor Chase, in communication
with the Ohio Board of Agriculture, from which I
have obtained elaborate statistics, together with reports on
the subject from twelve Presidents or Secretaries of County
Agricultural Societies, as well as from others. These gentlemen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
generally testify that a certain amount of labour given to
corn will be much better repaid than if given to tobacco.
“Men are worth too much for growing corn to be employed
in strolling through tobacco fields, looking for worms, and
even women can, as our farmers think, find something better
to do about the house.” Children, too, are thought to be,
and doubtless are, better employed at school in preparing
themselves for more profitable duties, and this is probably the
chief reason why coarse tobacco<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> cannot be cultivated with as
much profit as corn in Ohio, while the want of intelligent, self-interested
labour, is the reason why the corn-field, among the
tall broad blades of which a man will work during much of its
growth in comparative obscurity, cannot be cultivated with as
much profit on soils of the same quality in Virginia as in Ohio.
In short, a class of labourers, who are good for nothing else,
and who, but for this, would be an intolerable burden upon
those who are obliged to support them, can be put to some use
in raising tobacco, and, therefore, coarse tobacco continues to
be cultivated in some of the principal slaveholding counties
of Virginia. But this class of labourers is of no more value
in cotton culture than in corn culture. Mr. De Bow says:
“The South-west, the great cotton region, is newly settled,
and the number of children, out of all proportion, less than in
negroes [regions?] peopled, by a natural growth of population.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Weak women and children are, in fact, not at all wanted for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
cotton culture, the cotton planter’s inquiry being exclusively
for ‘prime boys,’ or ‘A 1 field-hands.’”</p>

<p>Thus in every way cotton culture more resembles corn culture
than it does tobacco culture. The production of corn
is larger in the aggregate, is considerably larger per man
engaged in its cultivation, and is far larger per acre in Ohio
than in Virginia.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> I should, therefore, be inclined to reverse
Mr. Russell’s statement, and to say that if the climate had
admitted of the growing of cotton on both banks of the Ohio,
we should have seen that free-labour possessed as great advantages
over slavery in the cultivation of cotton as of corn.</p>

<p>Mr. Russell echoes also the opinion, which every cotton
planter is in the habit of urging, that the production of cotton
would have been comparatively insignificant in the United
States if it had not been for slave labour. He likewise restricts
the available cotton region within much narrower
limits than are usually given to it, and holds that the slave
population must soon in a great measure be concentrated
within it. As these conclusions of a scientific traveller unintentionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
support a view which has been lately systematically
pressed upon manufacturers and merchants both in Great
Britain and the Free States, namely, that the perpetuation of
slavery in its present form is necessary to the perpetuation of
a liberal cotton supply, and also that the limit of production
in the United States must be rapidly approaching, and consequently
that the tendency of prices must be rapidly upward,
the grounds on which they rest should be carefully scrutinized.</p>

<p>Mr. Russell says, in a paragraph succeeding the words
just now quoted with regard to the supposed advantages of
slave labour in raising tobacco:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The rich upland soils of the cotton region afford a profitable investment
for capital, even when cultivated by slaves left to the care of overseers.
The natural increase of the slaves, from two to six per cent., goes
far to pay the interest of the money invested in them. The richest soils
of the uplands are invariably occupied by the largest plantations, and the
alluvial lands on the banks of the western rivers are so unhealthy for
white labourers that the slaveowners occupy them without competition.
Thus the banks of the western rivers are now becoming the great cotton-producing
districts. Taking these facts into consideration, it appears that
the quantity of cotton which would have been raised without slave labour
in the United States would have been comparatively insignificant to the
present supply.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The advantages of slave-labour for cotton culture seem from
this to have been predicated mainly upon the unwholesomeness
to free or white labourers of the best cotton lands, especially
of the alluvial lands on the banks of rivers. Reference is
made particularly to “the county of Washington, Mississippi
State [which] lies between the Yazoo and Mississippi rivers.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp; The soil is chiefly alluvial, though a considerable
portion is swampy and liable to be flooded.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Russell evidently considers that it is to this swampy condition,
and to stagnant water left by floods, that the supposed
insalubrity of this region is to be chiefly attributed. How would
he explain, then, the undoubted salubrity of the bottom lands in
Louisiana, which are lower than those of the Mississippi, exposed
to a more southern sun, more swampy, and which were originally
much more frequently flooded, but having been dyked and
“leveed,” are now inhabited by a white population of several
hundred thousand. I will refer to the evidence of an expert:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Heat, moisture, animal and vegetable matter, are said to be the elements
which produce the diseases of the South, and yet the testimony in
proof of the health of the banks of the lower portion of the Mississippi
river is too strong to be doubted. Here is a perfectly flat alluvial country,
covering several hundred miles, interspersed with interminable lakes,
lagunes, and jungles, and still we are informed by Dr. Cartwright, one of
the most acute observers of the day, that this country is exempt from miasmatic
disorders, and is extremely healthy. His assertion has been confirmed
to me by hundreds of witnesses; and we know, from our own observation,
that the population presents a robust and healthy appearance.”
(Statistics are given to prove a greater average length of life for the white
race in the South than in the North.)—<span class="smcap">Essay on the Value of Life in
the South</span>, by Dr. J. C. Nott, of Alabama.</p>
</div>

<p>To the same effect is the testimony of a far more trustworthy
scientific observer, Darby, the surveyor and geographer
of Louisiana:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Between the 9th of July, 1805, to the 7th of May, 1815, incredible as
it may appear to many persons, I actually travelled [in Southern Alabama,
Mississippi, Louisiana, and, what is now, Texas] twenty thousand miles,
mostly on foot. During the whole of this period, I was not confined one
month, put all my indispositions together, and not one moment by any
malady attributable to climate. I have slept in the open air for weeks
together, in the hottest summer nights, and endured this mode of life in
the most matted woods, perhaps, in the world. During my survey of the
Sabine river, myself, and the men that attended me, existed, for several
weeks, on flesh and fish, without bread or salt, and without sickness of
any kind. That nine-tenths of the distempers of warm climate may be
guarded against, I do not harbour a single doubt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>“If climate operates extensively upon the actions of human beings, it is
principally their amusements that are regulated by proximity to the
tropics. Dancing might be called the principal amusement of both sexes,
in Louisiana. Beholding the airy sweep of a Creole dance, the length of
time that an assembly will preserve in the sport, at any season of the
year, cold or warm, indolence would be the last charge that candour
could lodge against such a people.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>
</div>

<p>“Copying from Montesquieu,” elsewhere says Mr. Darby,
himself a slaveholder, “climate has been called upon to account
for stains on the human character, imprinted by the hand of
political mistake. No country where Negro Slavery is established
but must have parts in the wounds committed on
nature and justice.”</p>

<p>The unacclimated whites on the sea coast and on the river
and bayou banks of the low country, between which and the
sea coast there is much inter-communication, unquestionably
suffer much from certain epidemic, contagious, and infectious
pestilences. This, however, only renders the fact that dense
settlements of whites have been firmly established upon them,
and that they are remarkably exempt from miasmatic disease,
one of more value in evidence of the practicability of white
occupation of the upper bottom lands. There are grounds for
doubting the common opinion that the negroes at the South
suffer less from local causes of disease than whites. (See<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
“Seaboard Slave States,” p. 647.) They may be less subject
to epidemic and infectious diseases, and yet be more liable to
other fatal disorders, due to such influences, than whites.
The worst climate for unacclimated whites of any town in the
United States is that of Charleston. (This, together with
the whole of the rice coast, is clearly exceptional in respect
of salubrity for whites.) It happens fortunately that
the most trustworthy and complete vital statistics of the
South are those of Charleston. Dr. Nott, commenting upon
these, says that the average mortality, during six years, has
been, of blacks alone, one in forty-four; of whites alone, one
in fifty-eight. “This mortality” he adds, “is perhaps not an
unfair test, as the population during the last six years has
been undisturbed by emigration, and acclimated in greater
proportion than at any previous period.” If the comparison
had been made between native negroes and native or acclimated
whites alone, it would doubtless show the climate to be
still more unfavourable to negroes.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Upon the very district to which Mr. Russell refers, as offering
an extreme case, I quote the testimony of a Mississippi
statistician:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The cotton-planters, deserting the rolling land, are fast pouring in
upon the ‘swamp.’ Indeed, the impression of the sickliness of the South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
generally has been rapidly losing ground [<i>i. e.</i> among the whites of the
South] for some years back, and that blessing [health] is now sought with
as much confidence on the swamp lands of the Yazoo and the Mississippi
as among the hills and plains of Carolina and Virginia.”—(De Bow’s
“Resources,” vol. ii., p. 43.)</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Barton says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In another place I have shown that the direct temperature of the sun
is not near so great in the South (during the summer) as it is at the
North. I shall recur to this hereafter. In fact, the climate is much more
endurable, all the year round, with our refreshing breezes, and particularly
in some of the more elevated parts of it, or within one hundred miles of
the coast, both in and out of doors, at the South than at the North,
which shows most conspicuously the folly of the annual summer migrations,
to pursue an imaginary mildness of temperature, which is left at
home.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Russell assumes that slave labour tends, as a matter of
course, to the formation of large plantations, and that free
labour can only be applied to agricultural operations of a
limited scope. Of slaves, he says: “Their numbers admit of
that organization and division of labour which renders slavery
so serviceable in the culture of cotton.” I find no reason given
for this assertion, except that he did not himself see any large
agricultural enterprises conducted with free labour, while he
did see many plantations of fifty to one hundred slave hands.
The explanation, in my judgment, is that the cultivation of
the crops generally grown in the Free States has hitherto been
most profitable when conducted on the “small holding”
system;<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> the cultivation of cotton is, as a general rule, more
profitable upon the “large holding” system.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Undoubtedly
there is a point below which it becomes disadvantageous to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
reduce the farm in the Free States, and this varies with local
circumstances. There is equally a limit beyond which it is
acknowledged to be unprofitable to enlarge the body of slaves
engaged in cotton cultivation under one head. If cotton were
to be cultivated by free labour, it is probable that this number
would be somewhat reduced. I have no doubt that the number
of men on each plantation, in any case, would, on an average,
much nearer approach that which would be most economical,
in a free-labour cotton-growing country than in a
country on which the whole dependence of each proprietor
was on slaves. Is not this conclusion irresistible when we consider
that the planter, if he needs an additional slave hand to
those he possesses, even if temporarily, for harvesting his crop,
must, in most cases, employ at least a thousand dollars of
capital to obtain it?</p>

<p>Mr. Russell has himself observed that—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The quantity of cotton which can be produced on a [slave-worked]
plantation is limited by the number of hands it can turn into the field
during the picking or harvesting of the crop. Like some other agricultural
operations, this is a simple one, though it does not admit of being
done by machinery, as a certain amount of intelligence must direct the
hand.”</p>
</div>

<p>The same is true of a wheat farm, except that much more
can be done by machinery, and consequently the extraordinary
demand for labour at the wheat harvest is much less than it is
on a cotton plantation. I have several times been on the
Mississippi plantation during picking time, and have seen how
everything black, with hands, was then pressed into severe
service; but, after all, I have often seen negroes breaking down,
in preparation for re-ploughing the ground for the next crop,
acres of cotton plants, upon which what appeared to me to be a
tolerable crop of wool still hung, because it had been impossible
to pick it. I have seen what was confessed to be many hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
dollars’ worth, of cotton thus wasted on a single Red-River
plantation. I much doubt if the harvest demand of the
principal cotton districts of Mississippi adds five per cent. to
their field-hand force. In Ohio, there is a far larger population
ordinarily engaged in other pursuits which responds to
the harvest demand. A temporary increase of the number of
agricultural labourers thus occurs of not less than forty per
cent. during the most critical period.</p>

<p>An analogous case is that of the vintage in the wine districts
of France. In some of these the “small holding” or <i>parcellement</i>
system is carried to an unfortunate extreme under the
influence of what are, perhaps, injudicious laws. The parcels
of land are much smaller, on an average, than the smallest
class of farms ordinarily cultivated by free labour in the
United States. But can any one suppose that if the slave
labour system, as it exists in the United States, prevailed in
those districts, that is to say, if the proprietors depended solely
on themselves, their families, and their regular servants, as
those of Mississippi must, at the picking time, there would
not be a disastrous falling off in the commerce of those
districts? Substitute the French system, unfortunate as in
some respects it is, for the Mississippi system in cotton growing,
and who will doubt that the cotton supply of the United
States would be greatly increased?</p>

<p>Hop picking and cotton picking are very similar operations.
The former is the more laborious, and requires the greater
skill. What would the planters of Kent do if they had no
one but their regular labourers to call upon at their harvest
season?</p>

<p>I observed this advantage of the free labour system exemplified
in Western Texas, the cotton fields in the vicinity of the
German village of New Braunfels having been picked, when I
saw them, far closer than any I had before seen, in fact, perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
clean, having been undoubtedly gleaned, by the poor
emigrants. I was told that some mechanics made more in a
day, by going into the field of a slaveowner and picking side by
side with his slaves, being paid by measure, than they could
earn at their regular work in a week. The degree of intelligence
and of practice required to pick to advantage was found
to be very slight, less, very much, than in any single operation
of wheat harvesters. One woman was pointed out to me
who had, in the first year she had ever seen a cotton field,
picked more cotton in a day than any slave in the county.</p>

<p>I am reminded, as this page is about to be stereotyped, by
observing the letter of a cotton planter in the New Orleans
Price Current, of another disadvantage for cotton production,
of slave labour, or rather of the system which slavery induces.
In my volume on Texas, I stated that I was informed by a
merchant that the cotton picked by the free labour of the
Germans was worth from one to two cents a pound more than
that picked by slaves in the same township, by reason of its
greater cleanliness. From the letter referred to, I make the
following extracts:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp; There are probably no set of men engaged in
any business of life who take as little pains and care to inform themselves
with regard to the character and quality of their marketable produce as
the cotton-planter. Not one in a thousand knows, nor cares to know,
whether the cotton he sends to market is ordinary, good ordinary, or
middling. Not one in a hundred spends one hour of each day at his gin
in ginning season; never sees the cotton after it is gathered, unless he
happens to ride near the scaffold and looks from a distance of a hundred
yards, and declares the specimen very white and clean, when, perhaps, it,
on the contrary, may be very leafy and dirty. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I have often seen the hands on plantations picking cotton with sacks
that would hardly hold stalks, they were so torn and full of holes; these
sacks dragging on the ground and gathering up pounds of dirt at every
few steps. The baskets, too, were with scarcely any bottoms remaining,
having been literally worn out, the cotton lying on the ground. Indeed,
some overseers do not forbid the hands emptying their cotton on the
ground when their sacks are full, and they some distance from their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
baskets. When this cotton is taken up, some dirt must necessarily come
with it. When gathering in wet weather, the hands get into their baskets
with muddy feet, and thus toss in some pounds of dirt, in this way making
their task easier. These things are never, or rarely, seen by the proprietor:
and, consequently, when his merchant writes him that his cotton is a little
dusty, he says how can it be? you are surely mistaken.</p>

<p>“Now, sir, for all this there is one simple, plain remedy; let the planter
spend his time in ginning season at his gin; let him see every load of
cotton as it comes from the field and before it goes through the gin. But,
says the man of leisure, the gin is a dirty, dusty place. Yes, sir, and
always will be so, until you remedy the evil by staying there yourself.
You say your overseer is hired to do this dirty work. <i>Your overseer is
after quantity, sir, and the more extra weight he gets in your cotton, the more
bales he will have to brag of having made at the end of the year. Don’t trust
him at the gin.</i> *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Probably he has a conditional contract with his employer: <i>gets so
many dollars for all he makes over a certain number of bales; thus having
every inducement to put up as much leaf and dirt, or, if he is one of the
dishonest kind, he may add stones, if they should abound in the neighbourhood</i>.</p>

<p>“Why will not the cotton-planter take pride in his own production?
The merchant prides himself on his wares; the mechanic on the work of
his hands. All seem to pride themselves on the result of their labour
except the cotton-planter.” *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<p>It cannot be admitted that the absence in the Free States
of that organization and division of labour in agriculture
which is found on a large slave-worked plantation is a necessity
attending the use of free labour. Why should it be any
more impossible to employ an army of free labourers in
moving the ground with an agricultural design than with the
intention of constructing a canal or a road, if it were profitable
to so employ the necessary capital? A railroad contractor
in one of the best cotton districts of the United States
told me, that having begun his work with negroes, he was
substituting Irish and German labourers for them as rapidly
as possible, with great advantage (and this near midsummer).
But if I were convinced with Mr. Russell upon this point, I
should still be inclined to think that the advantages which
are possessed in a free labour state of society equally by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
great hop-planters at picking time and the <i>petits proprietaires</i>
at vintage, which are also found in our own new States by the
wheat farmer, and which are not found under the present
system anywhere at the South, for cotton picking, would of
themselves be sufficient to turn the scale in favour of the free-labour
cotton grower.</p>

<p>The error of the assumption by Mr. Russell, that large
gangs of unwilling labourers are essential or important to
cotton production in the United States, is, I trust, apparent.
And as to the more common and popular opinion, that the
necessary labour of cotton tillage is too severe for white men
in the cotton-growing climate, I repeat that I do not find
the slightest weight of fact to sustain it. The necessary
labour and causes of fatigue and vital exhaustion attending
any part, or all, of the process of cotton culture does not
compare with that of our July harvesting; it is not greater
than attends the cultivation of Indian corn in the usual New
England method. I have seen a weakly white woman the
worse for her labour in the cotton field, but never a white
man, and I have seen hundreds of them at work in cotton
fields under the most unfavourable circumstances, miserable,
dispirited wretches, and of weak muscle, subsisting mainly,
as they do, on corn bread. Mr. De Bow estimates one hundred
thousand white men now engaged in the cultivation of
cotton, being one ninth of the whole cotton force (numerically)
of the country.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> I have just seen a commercial
letter from San Antonio, which estimates that the handful of
Germans in Western Texas will send ten thousand bales of
cotton, the production of their own labour, to market this season.
If it should prove to be but half this, it must be considered
a liberal contribution to the needed supply of the year, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
those who, following Mr. Russell, have considered Western
Texas out of the true cotton region, and taking the truth
of the common planters’ assertion for granted, have thought
Africans, working under physical compulsion, the only means
of meeting the demand which could be looked to in the future
of the United States.</p>

<p>It would not surprise me to learn that the cultivation of
cotton by the German settlers in Texas had not, after all,
been as profitable as its cultivation by the planters employing
slaves in the vicinity. I should attribute the superior profits
of the planter, if any there be, however, not to the fitness
of the climate for negro labour, and its unfitness for white
labour, but to the fact that his expenses for fencing, on account
of his larger fields and larger estate, are several hundred
per cent. less than those of the farmer; to the fact that
his expenses for tillage, having mules and ploughs and other
instruments to use at the opportune moment, are less than
those of the farmer, who, in many cases, cannot afford to
own a single team; to the fact that he has, from experience,
a better knowledge of the most successful method of cultivation;
to the fact that he has a gin and a press of his own
in the midst of his cotton fields, to which he can carry his
wool at one transfer from the picking; by which he can put
it in order for market expeditiously, and at an expense much
below that falling upon the farmer, who must first store his
wool, then send it to the planter’s gin and press and have
it prepared at the planter’s convenience, paying, perhaps,
exorbitantly therefor; and, finally, to the fact that the
planter deals directly with the exporter, while the farmer,
the whole profit of whose crop would not pay his expenses in
a journey to the coast, must transfer his bale or two to the
exporter through two or three middle-men, carrying it one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
bale at a time, to the local purchaser. Merchants will never
give as good prices for small lots as for large. There are
reasons for this which I need not now explain. I consider,
in short, that the disadvantages of the farmer in growing
cotton are of the same nature as I have before explained
with those which long ago made fire-wood of hand-looms,
and paupers of those who could be nothing else but hand-loom
weavers, in Massachusetts. Exactly how much is
gained by the application of labour with the advantage of
capital and combination of numbers over its isolated application
as directed by individuals without capital in a slaveholding
region, I cannot estimate, but no one will doubt that it
is considerable. Nevertheless, in all the cotton climate of the
United States, if a white farmer has made money without
slaves, it will be found that it has been, in most cases,
obtained exclusively from the sale of cotton. If cotton is
a plant the cultivation of which by free or white labour is
especially difficult, how is it that, with the additional embarrassments
arising from a lack of capital, his gains are
almost exclusively derived from his cotton crop?</p>

<p>But I may be asked, if combination is what is needed to
make cotton a source of more general prosperity at the South,
why is there no such thing as a joint-stock cotton plantation
in Mississippi, as there are joint-stock cotton mills in Massachusetts,
the stock in which is in large part owned by those
employed in them? I ask, in reply, how is it that the common
way of obtaining breadstuffs in Northern Alabama is to
sow three pecks of seed wheat on hard stubble ground, plough
it under with unbroken bullocks, led with a rope, and a bull-tongue
plough, and finally to garner rarely so much as six
bushels from an acre? How is it that while in Ohio the spinning-wheel
and hand-loom are curiosities, and homespun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
would be a conspicuous and noticeable material of clothing,
half the white population of Mississippi still dress in homespun,
and at every second house the wheel and loom are
found in operation? The same influences which condemn
the majority of free labourers in Alabama to hand-looms,
homespun, and three hundred pounds of wheat to the acre,
as the limit of production, also condemn them to isolated
labour, poor soil, poor tools, bad management, “bad luck,”
small crops, and small profits in cotton culture.</p>

<p>The following passages from a letter published in the
<i>New York Times</i> present convincing evidence that it is
no peculiarity of the Western Texas climate, but only the
exceptional social condition with which its people are
favoured, that enables free white labour to be employed in
increasing the cotton production of the country. I have
ascertained that the author of the letter is known to the
editor of the <i>Times</i>, and is esteemed a gentleman of veracity
and trustworthy judgment.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am well acquainted with Eastern Mississippi, south of Monroe county,
and there are few settlements where my name or face is unknown in the
following counties, over the greater part of which I have ridden on horseback,
to wit: Loundes, Oktibleha, Choctaw, Carroll, Attalla, Winston,
Noxubee, Kemper, Nashoba, Leake, Scott, Newton, Lauderdale, Clarke,
Smith, and Jasper. After four years’ travel through these counties,
transacting business with great numbers of their inhabitants, stopping at
their houses, conversing much with them, and viewing their mode of
living, I unhesitatingly answer that white men can and do labour in the
cotton field, from Christmas to Christmas following; and that there, as
elsewhere, prudence, industry, and energy find their universal reward:
success and wealth.</p>

<p>“In the counties of Choctaw, Winston, Nashoba, Newton, and Smith,
there are very few large plantations; most of those having slaves holding
but two or three, while those who own none are in the majority; yet these
are all cotton-growing counties, and the staple of their cotton, poor as
their lands are, is equal to the average sold in the Mobile market.
Where the young farmer is enterprising and go-ahead, his cotton is usually
superior. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>“The rich lands where white labour, even in small numbers, might be
profitable, are either in the hands of large planters, or too heavily
timbered for a single man. The only thing now preventing any poor
white man in the South from gaining a fair competence, and even
attaining wealth, is his own laziness, shiftlessness, and ignorance; for
the small planters in the counties I have mentioned are deplorably
ignorant. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>

<p>“There is one case I remember, which is to the point; the man lives in
Choctaw county, and was born in Georgia. He does not own a negro, but
has two boys, one sixteen, the other twelve. With the assistance of these
boys, and the most imperfect agricultural implements, he made twenty-two
bales of cotton, year before last, plenty of corn, and sufficient small grain
for himself and family, although the season was more than ordinarily bad
in his neighbourhood, while many of his neighbours, with five or six
slaves, did not exceed him, and some made even less. He went on to his
place without ten dollars in his pocket, gave his notes for eight hundred
dollars, payable in one, two, and three years’ time, with interest at six per
cent. per annum, and the ensuing year he purchased another one hundred
and sixty acres for seven hundred and fifty dollars, also on time. This
man is, however, far more intelligent and progressive in farming than
those about him; he does not plant as did his grandfather, because his
father did so, but endeavours to improve, and is willing to try an experiment
occasionally.</p>

<p>“In my own county, in Alabama, there is a woman whose husband died
shortly after the crop was planted, leaving her without a single servant,
and no assistance except from a little son of twelve years of age: yet she
went into the field, ploughed and picked her cotton, prepared her ground
for the coming crop, and raised a second crop thereon.”</p>
</div>

<p>My conclusion, from the various evidences to which I have
referred, must be a widely different one from Mr. Russell’s,
from that which is generally thought to prevail with our leading
capitalists, merchants, and manufacturers, and from that which
seems to have been accepted by the Cotton Supply Associations
of Liverpool and Manchester. It is this: that there is
no physical obstacle in the way of our country’s supplying ten
bales of cotton where it now does one. All that is necessary
for this purpose is to direct to the cotton-producing region
an adequate number of labourers, either black or white, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
both. No amalgamation, no association on equality, no violent
disruption of present relations is necessary. It is not even
requisite that both black and white should work in the cotton
fields. It is necessary that there should be more objects of industry,
more varied enterprises, more general intelligence among
the people, and especially that they should become, or should
desire to become, richer, more comfortable, than they are.</p>

<p>The simple truth is, that even if we view in the brightest
light of Fourth of July patriotism, the character of the whites
of the cotton-producing region, and the condition of the
slaves, we cannot help seeing that, commercially speaking,
they are but in a very small part a civilized people. Undoubtedly
a large number of merchants have had, at times, a
profitable business in supplying civilized luxuries and conveniences
to the South. The same is true of Mexico, of
Turkey, of Egypt, and of Russia. Silk, cloth, and calico,
shoes, gloves, and gold watches, were sold in some quantity
in California, before its golden coffers were forcibly opened
ten years ago. The Southern supply to commerce and the
Southern demand of commerce is no more what it should be,
comparing the resources of the South with those of other
lands occupied by an active civilized community, than is
that of any half-civilized community, than was that of California.
Give the South a people moderately close settled,
moderately well-informed, moderately ambitious, and moderately
industrious, somewhat approaching that of Ohio, for
instance, and what a business it would have! Twenty double-track
railroads from the Gulf to the lakes, and twenty lines of
ocean steamers, would not sufficiently meet its requirements.
Who doubts, let him study the present business of Ohio, and
ask upon what, in the natural resources of Ohio, or its position,
could, forty years ago, a prediction of its present wealth and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
business have been made, of its present supply and its present
demand have been made, which would compare in value with
the commercial resources and advantages of position possessed
to-day by any one of the Western cotton States?<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br>
<span class="s08">THE CONDITION AND CHARACTER OF THE PRIVILEGED CLASSES
OF THE SOUTH.</span></h2>

<p>Since the growth of the cotton demand has doubled the value
of slave labour, and with it the pecuniary inducement to prevent
negroes from taking care of themselves, hypotheses and
easy methods for justifying the everlasting perpetuation of
slavery have been multiplied. I have not often conversed
with a planter about the condition of the slaves, that he did
not soon make it evident, that a number of these were on
service in his own mind, naïvely falling back from one to
another, if a few inquiries about matters of fact were addressed
him without obvious argumentative purpose. The
beneficence of slavery is commonly urged by an exposition
not only of the diet, and the dwellings, and the jollity, and
the devotional eloquence of the negroes, but also by demonstrations
of the high mental attainments to which individuals
are already found to be arriving. Thus, there is always at
hand, some negro mathematician, who is not merely held to
be far in advance of the native Africans, but who beats most
white men in his quickness and accuracy in calculation, and
who is at the same time considered to be so thoroughly trustworthy,
that he is constantly employed by his master as an
accountant and collecting agent; or some negro whose reputation
for ingenuity and skill in the management and repair
of engines, sugar-mills, cotton-presses, or other machinery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
is so well established that his services are more highly valued,
throughout a considerable district, than any white man’s;
or some negro who really manages his owner’s plantation,
his agricultural judgment being deferred to, as superior to
that of any overseer or planter in the county. Scarcely a
plantation did I visit on which some such representative black
man was not acknowledged and made a matter of boasting
by the owner, who, calling attention perhaps to the expression
of intelligence and mien of self-confidence which distinguished
his premium specimen, would cheerfully give me a history of
the known special circumstances, practically constituting a
special mental feeding, by which the phenomenon was to be
explained. Yet it might happen that the same planter would
presently ask, pointing to the brute-like countenance of a
moping field-hand, what good would freedom be to such a
creature? And this would be one who had been provided
from childhood with food, and shelter, and clothing, with as
little consideration of his own therefor as for the air he
breathed; who had not been allowed to determine for himself
with whom he should associate; with what tools and to what
purpose he should labour; who had had no care on account
of his children; who had no need to provide for old age; who
had never had need to count five-and-twenty; the highest
demand upon whose faculties had been to discriminate between
cotton and crop-grass, and to strike one with a hoe
without hitting the other; to whose intelligence, though
living in a civilized land, the pen and the press, the mail and
the telegraph, had contributed nothing; who had no schooling
as a boy; no higher duty as a man than to pick a given
quantity of cotton between dawn and dark; and of whom,
under this training and these confinements, it might well be
wondered that he was found able to understand and to speak the
language of human intelligence any more than a horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>Again, one would assure me that he had witnessed in his
own time an obvious advance in the quality of the slaves
generally; they were more active, less stupid, employed a
larger and more exact vocabulary, and were less superstitious,
obstinate, and perverse in their habits of mind than when he
was himself a boy; but I had only to presume that, with this
rapid improvement, the negroes would soon be safely allowed
to take some step toward freedom, to be assured with much
more apparent confidence than before, that in the special
quality which originally made the negro a slave, there had
been no gain; that indeed it was constantly becoming more
evident that he was naturally too deficient in forecasting
capacity to be able to learn how to take civilized care of
himself.</p>

<p>As a rule, when the beneficence of slavery is argued by
Southerners, an advancing intellectual as well as moral condition
of the mass of negroes is assumed, and the high attainments
of individuals are pointed to as evidence of what is to
be expected of the mass, if the system is not disturbed.
Suggest that any modification of the system would enlarge its
beneficence, however, and an exception to the general rule, as
regards the single quality of providence, is at once alleged,
and in such a manner, that one cannot but get the impression
that, in this quality, the negro is believed to be retrograding
as surely as he is advancing in everything else; and this is
one method by which the unconditional perpetuation of the
system, as it is, is justified. Such a justification must of
course involve the supposition that in the tenth generation of
an unremitted training, discipline, education, and custom in
abject dependence upon a voluntary provision by others, for
every wish of which the gratification is permitted, <i>white</i> men
would be able, as a rule, to <i>gain</i> in the quality of providence
and capacity for independent self-support.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span></p>

<p>As to the real state of the case, I find, in my own observation,
no reason for doubting, what must be expected of
those interested, that the general improvement of the slave is
usually somewhat overrated, and his forecasting ability underrated.
Measures intended to prevent a man from following
his natural inclinations often have the effect of stimulating
those inclinations; and I believe that the system which is
designed not merely to relieve the negro from having any
care for himself, but, as far as practicable, to forcibly prevent
him from taking care of himself, in many particulars to
which he has more or less instinctive inclination, instead of
gradually suppressing this inclination, to some extent stimulates
it, so that the Southern negro of to-day, however
depraved in his desires, and however badly instructed, is
really a man of more cunning, shrewdness, reticence, and
persistence, in what he does undertake for himself, than his
father was. The healthful use of these qualities (which
would constitute providence) is, however, in general, successfully
opposed by slavery, and, as far as the slave is concerned,
nothing worse than this can be said of the system.</p>

<p>Admitting that, in this view, slavery is not beneficent, or
is no longer beneficent, or can be but for a time beneficent to
the slave, the present attitude of the South still finds a mode
of justification with many minds, in the broad assertion that
the negro is not of the nature of mankind, therefore cannot be
a subject of inhumanity. This, of course, sweeps the field, if
it does anything: thus (from the Day-Book)—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The wide-spread delusion that Southern institutions are an evil, and
their extension dangerous—the notion so prevalent at the North that there
is a real antagonism, or that the system of the South is hostile to Northern
interests; the weakened union sentiment, and the utter debauchment, the
absolute traitorism of a portion of the Northern people, not only to the
Union, but to Democratic institutions, and to the cause of civilization on
this continent; all these, with the minor and most innumerable mischiefs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
that this mighty world-wide imposture has engendered or drags in its
midst, rest upon the dogma, the single assumption, the sole elementary
foundation falsehood, that a negro is a black man.”</p>
</div>

<p>This bold ground is not as often taken at the South as by
desperate bidders for Southern confidence among ourselves.
I have heard Christian men, however, when pushed for a
justification of the sealing up of the printed Bible, of the legal
disregard of marriage, of giving power to rascally traders to
forcibly separate families, and so on, refer to it as a hypothesis
not at all to be scouted under such circumstances. Yet, as
they did so, there stood behind their chairs, slaves, in whose
veins ran more Anglo-Saxon blood than of any African race’s
blood, and among their other slaves, it is probable there were
many descendants of Nubians, Moors, Egyptians, and Indians,
all interbred with white and true negro tribes, so that it
would be doubtful if there remained one single absolutely pure
negro, to which animal alone their argument would strictly
apply. If the right or expediency of denying the means of
preparing themselves for freedom to these beings could even
be held to be coexistent with the evident preponderance in
them of certain qualities of form, colour, etc., the number of
those who are held unjustly or inexpediently in the bonds of
a perpetual slavery is already quite large in the South, and is
gradually but surely increasing—is increasing much more
rapidly than are their means of cultivating habits which are
necessary to be cultivated, before the manliest child of white
men is capable of enjoying freedom.</p>

<p>There are but two methods of vindicating the habit of depending
on the labour of slaves for the development of wealth
in the land, which appear to me, on the face of them,
entitled to be treated gravely. One of these, assuming the
beings held in slavery to be as yet generally incompetent to
take care of themselves in a civilized manner, and dangerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
to the life as well as to the wealth of the civilized people who
hold them in slavery, argues that it is necessary for their
humane maintenance, and to prevent them from acquiring an
increase of the disposition and strength of mind and will
which has always been felt a source of danger to the well-being
of their masters, that all the present laws for their
mental repression should be rigidly maintained. It is not to
be denied, I think, that there is some ground for this assumption.
Inasmuch as it is also argued that the same
necessity requires that these beings, and with them all these
laws, should be carried on to territory now free from them,
we are called upon to give a sober consideration to the argument
which is based upon it. This I shall do in the last
chapter. The other method to which I refer assumes that by
having a well-defined class set apart for drudging and servile
labour, the remainder of a community may be preserved free
from the demeaning habits and traits of character which, it is
alleged, servile and menial obligations and the necessity of a
constant devotion to labour are sure to fix upon those who are
subject to them. Hence a peculiar advantage in morals and
in manners is believed to belong to the superior class of a
community so divided. I am inclined to think that there is
no method of justifying slavery, which is more warmly
cherished by those interested to maintain it, than this. I am
sure that there is none which planters are more ready to
suggest to their guests.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>
<p>No sensible man among us shuts his eyes to the ignorance,
meanness, vice, and misery which accompanies our general
prosperity; no class of statesmen, no politicians or demagogues,
no writers deny or ignore it. It is canvassed, published,
studied, struggled with, by all honest men, and this not
in our closets alone, but in our churches, our legislatures, our
colleges, our newspapers, our families. We are constantly
urging, constantly using means for discovering it and setting
it forth plainly. We commission able men to make a business
of bringing it to the light, and we publish the statistics which
their labours supply as legislative documents to be circulated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
at the general expense, in order that our misfortune
may be as well known and as exactly comprehended as
possible.</p>

<p>From much of all this, which so painfully and anxiously
concerns us, we are told that the South is free. We are
told that what we bewail is seen at the South to be the result
of a mistaken social system; that the South escapes that result
by slavery. We do not deny, we daily acknowledge that
there are mistakes in our system; we endeavour to remedy
them; and we not unfrequently have to acknowledge that in
doing so, we have made some of our bad things worse. Does
slavery relieve all? And without compensation? We often
find, upon a thorough review, that our expedients, while they
have for a time seemed to produce very valuable results,
have in fact corrected one evil by creating or enhancing
another. We have borrowed from Peter to pay Paul. In
this way we find investigation and discussion to be constantly
essential to prevent errors and mistakes from being exaggerated
and persevered in unnecessarily. Thus we—our honestly
humane part at least—are ever calling for facts, ever publishing,
proclaiming, discussing the facts of our evil. It is
only those whose selfish interest is thought by themselves to
be served by negligence, who resist investigation and publication,
who avoid discussion. Thus we come to habitually
associate much activity of discussion, much consideration,
much publication with improvement—often no doubt erroneously—still
it is natural and rational that when we find
no discussion of facts, no publication, no consideration, where
we find general consideration and general discussion practically
prevented by a forcible resistance to publication,
we cannot but suspect there is something sadly needing
to be made better. And this last we do find to be
the case at the South, and with regard to slavery. Why,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
if their system has such tangible evidence of its advantages
within the personal knowledge of any citizen, do they
object to its alleged disadvantages being set forth for consideration,
and, if it should happen, discussion? True, we
may be wrong, we may be mistaken in supposing that this,
our constant publication and challenge to discussion is a good
thing. Perhaps if we were better, we should talk less, know
less of what evil remained to be gradually grown out of. It
might be found that the constant consideration of our evil had
had a bad effect upon us. But I have not found that the
people of the South are inclined to shut their eyes, and close
their ears, and bar their imaginations to the same evil.
With the misery which prevails among us, Southerners generally
appear to be, indeed, more familiar than the most industrious
of our home philanthropists. Great as it is, it is
really over-estimated at the South—over-estimated in the
aggregate at least; for it is perhaps impossible to over-estimate
the sufferings of individuals. South of Virginia, an
intelligent man or woman is rarely met who does not maintain,
with the utmost apparent confidence, that the people who
do the work of the North are, on the whole, harder driven,
worse fed, and more destitute of comfort than are the slaves at
the South, taking an average of both classes; and this I heard
assumed by gentlemen, the yearly cost of maintaining whose
own slaves, according to their statement to me, would not
equal the average monthly expenses of an equal number of
the poorest class of labourers I have ever known at the
North. I have heard it assumed by planters, who not only did
not themselves enjoy, but who never imagined or aspired to a
tithe of the comfort to which most journeymen mechanics
whom I have known are habituated. I have heard it assumed
by gentlemen, nine-tenths of whose neighbours for a hundred
miles around them lived in a manner which, if witnessed at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
the North, would have made them objects of compassion to
the majority of our day-labourers.</p>

<p>A gentleman coming up the Mississippi, just after a recent
“Southern Commercial Convention” at Memphis, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For three days I have been sitting at a table three times a day opposite
four of the fire-eaters. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp; It was evident that they were sincere:
for they declared to one another the belief that Providence was directing
the South to recommence the importation of Africans, that she might lead
the world to civilization and Christianity through its dependence upon her
soil for cotton. All their conversation was consistent with this. They
believed the South the centre of Christianity and the hope of the world,
while they had not the slightest doubt that the large majority of the
people of the North were much more to be pitied than their own negroes.
Exclusive of merchants, manufacturers, lawyers, and politicians, they
evidently imagined the whole population of the North to be quite similar
to the poor white population of the South. Yet they had travelled in the
North, it appeared. I could only conclude that their observation of
northern working men had been confined to the Irish operatives of
some half-finished western railroad, living in temporary shanties along the
route.”</p>
</div>

<p>I have even found that conservative men, who frankly
acknowledged the many bad effects of slavery, and confessed
the conviction that the Northern Slave States were ruined by
it; men who expressed admiration of Cassius Clay’s course,
and acknowledged no little sympathy with his views, and who
spoke with more contempt of their own fanatics than of the
Abolitionists themselves; that such men were inclined to
apologize for slavery, and for their own course in acting
politically for its extension and perpetuation, by assuming
certain social advantages to exist where it prevailed. “There
is a higher tone in Southern society than at the North,”
they would say, “which is, no doubt, due to the greater
leisure which slavery secures to us. There is less anxiety for
wealth, consequently more honesty. This also leads to the
habit of more generous living and of hospitality, which is
so characteristic of the South.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>I think that there is a type of character resulting in a
secondary way from slavery, of which Mr. Clay is himself a
noble example, which attracts admiration and affection in a
rare manner. I shall explain this secondary action of slavery
by-and-by. I have come to the conclusion that whatever may
be the good results of slavery in the way I shall then describe,
this so constantly asserted, so generally conceded, of inducing
a “higher tone” of breeding, and especially of nourishing the
virtue of hospitality, is chimerical.</p>

<p>Some reader may at once be inclined to say that the Southerners
whom he has met are unquestionably better bred
people than are common at the North, and that they state as
their experience that they do not find that hospitality, that
honesty, that guilelessness of dealing one with another among
the people of the North, to which they are accustomed at
home. It would remain a question, whether the Southerners
whom the reader has met are of a common or an exceptional
class; whether it is to slavery, or to some other circumstance,
they owe their breeding; whether this other circumstance is
dependent on slavery, or whether it may exist (and, if so,
whether, when it does exist, it produces the same fruit) quite
independently of slavery. It cannot be said that there are no
gentlemen and gentlewomen of first water in free countries.
A comparison, then, must be a comparison of numbers. I
shall, by-and-by, offer the reader some assistance in making a
comparison of this kind. And if, as we hear, free-labour
society is still an experiment, and one of the results of that
experiment is to be found in the low condition of portions of
our community, and it is by comparing this result with the
condition of the whites of the South that we must judge of
the success of the experiment; it may again be a question
of numbers. As to experience of hospitality, that is not a
question of quantity or of quality merely. I should wish to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
ask the reader’s Southern authorities, “Where and with whom
has your experience been, North and South?” And if with
a similar class and in similar circumstances, I should wish to
ask further, “What do you mean by hospitality?”</p>

<p>I think that the error which prevails in the South, with
regard to the general condition of our working people, is
much strengthened by the fact, that a different standard of
comfort is used by most persons at the South from that
known at the North, and that used by Northern writers.
People at the South are content and happy with a condition
which few accept at the North unless with great complaint,
or with expressions of resignation such as are the peculiar
property of slaves at the South. If, reader, you had been
travelling all day through a country of the highest agricultural
capability, settled more than twenty years ago, and
toward nightfall should be advised by a considerate stranger
to ride five miles further, in order to reach the residence of
Mr. Brown, because Mr. Brown, being a well-to-do man, and
a right good fellow, had built an uncommonly good house,
and got it well furnished, had a score of servants, and being
at a distance from neighbours, was always glad to entertain
a respectable stranger—after hearing this, as you continued
your ride somewhat impatiently in the evening chill, what
consolations would your imagination find in the prospect
before you? My New England and New York experience
would not forbid the hope of a private room, where I could,
in the first place, wash off the dust of the road, and make
some change of clothing before being admitted to a family
apartment. This family room would be curtained and carpeted,
and glowing softly with the light of sperm candles or
a shaded lamp. When I entered it, I could expect that a
couch or an arm-chair, and a fragrant cup of tea, with refined
sugar, and wholesome bread of wheaten flour, leavened,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
would be offered me. I should think it likely that I could
then have the snatch of Tannhäuser or Trovatore, which had
been running faintly in my head all day, fingered clearly out
to my entire satisfaction upon a pianoforte. I should then
look with perfect confidence to being able to refer to Shakespeare,
or Longfellow, or Dickens, if anything I had seen or
thought during the day had haply led me to wish to do so.
I should expect, as a matter of course, a clean, sweet bed,
where I could sleep alone and undisturbed, “until possibly in
the morning a jug of hot water should be placed at my door,
to aid the removal of a traveller’s rigid beard. I should
expect to draw a curtain from before a window, to lift the
sash without effort, to look into a garden and fill my lungs
with fragrant air; and I should be certain when I came down
of a royal breakfast. A man of these circumstances in this
rich country, he will be asking my opinion of his fruits. A
man of his disposition cannot exist in the country without
ladies, and ladies cannot exist in the country without flowers;
and might I not hope for the refinement which decks even
the table with them? and that the breakfast would be a meal
as well as a feed—an institution of mental and moral sustenance
as well as of palatable nourishment to the body? My
horse I need hardly look after, if he be a sound brute;—good
stables, litter, oats, hay, and water, grooming, and discretion
in their use, will never be wanting in such a man’s house in
the country.”</p>

<p>In what civilized region, after such advice, would such
thoughts be preposterous, unless in the Slave States? Not
but that such men and such houses, such family and home
comforts may be found in the South. I have found them a
dozen of them, delightful homes. But then in a hundred
cases where I received such advice, and heard houses and
men so described, I did not find one of the things imagined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
above, nor anything ranging with them. In my last journey
of nearly three months between the Mississippi and the
Upper James River, I saw not only none of those things,
received none of those attentions, but I saw and met nothing
of the kind. Nine times out of ten, at least, after such a
promise, I slept in a room with others, in a bed which stank,
supplied with but one sheet, if with any; I washed with
utensils common to the whole household; I found no garden,
no flowers, no fruit, no tea, no cream, no sugar, no bread;
(for corn pone—let me assert, in parenthesis, though possibly,
as tastes differ, a very good thing of its kind for ostriches—is
not bread: neither does even flour, salt, fat, and water, stirred
together and warmed, constitute bread;) no curtains, no
lifting windows (three times out of four absolutely no windows),
no couch—if one reclined in the family room it was on the
bare floor—for there were no carpets or mats. For all that,
the house swarmed with vermin. There was no hay, no
straw, no oats (but mouldy corn and leaves of maize), no
discretion, no care, no honesty, at the —— there was no stable,
but a log-pen; and besides this, no other out-house but a
smoke-house, a corn-house, and a range of nigger houses.</p>

<p>In nine-tenths of the houses south of Virginia, in which I
was obliged, making all reasonable endeavour to find the best,
to spend the night, there were none of these things. And
most of these had been recommended to me by disinterested
persons on the road as being better than ordinary—houses
where they “sot up for travellers and had things.” From
the banks of the Mississippi to the banks of James, I did not
(that I remember) see, except perhaps in one or two towns,
a thermometer, nor a book of Shakespeare, nor a pianoforte
or sheet of music; nor the light of a carcel or other good
centre-table or reading-lamp, nor an engraving or copy of any
kind, of a work of art of the slightest merit. I am not speaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
of what are commonly called “poor whites;” a large
majority of all these houses were the residences of shareholders,
a considerable proportion cotton-planters.</p>

<p>Those who watch the enormous export of cotton from the
South, and who are accustomed to reckon up its value, as it
goes forward, million on million, hundred million on hundred
million, year after year, say that it is incomprehensible, if it
be not incredible, that the people of the South are not rich
and living in luxury unknown elsewhere. It is asking too
much that such statements as I have made should be received
without any explanation. I have found this to be so, and so
far as the explanation appears in the attendant social phenomena
of the country, I shall endeavour to set it forth, sustaining
the accuracy of my report by the evidence of competent
Southern witnesses.</p>

<p>William H. Gregg, Esq., a distinguished citizen of Charleston,
South Carolina, in a report to the directors of the Graniteville
Manufacturing Company of that State, describes at length
the condition of the operatives of the company, whom he states
to have been drawn originally “from the poor of Edgefield,
Barnwell and Lexington districts.” These are cotton-growing
districts of South Carolina, better supplied than usual with
the ordinary advantages of civilized communities. For
instance, by reference to the census returns, I find that they
are provided with public schools at the rate of one to less than
thirty square miles, while within the State, inclusive of its
several towns, there is but one public school, on an average,
to every forty square miles. There are churches within these
districts, one to about seventeen square miles; throughout
the State, including Charleston and its other cities, one to
every twenty-five square miles. In Georgia the average is
one to thirty-two square miles. With the condition of the
newer cotton States, in these respects, that of Edgefield,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
Barnwell, and Lexington, would be found to compare still
more favourably for the poor. In Lexington there is even a
theological seminary. What, nevertheless, there is not generally
available to the people at large, Mr. Gregg indicates
by his statement of what advantages they possess who have
come to Graniteville.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When they were first brought together, the <i>seventy-nine</i> out of a
hundred grown girls who could neither read nor write were a by-word
around the country; that reproach has long since been removed. We
have night, Sunday, and week-day schools. Singing-masters, music-teachers,
writing-masters, and itinerant lecturers all find patronage in
Graniteville where the people can easily earn all the necessaries of
life, and are in the enjoyment of the usual luxuries of country life.” *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>

<p>“To get a steady supply of workmen, a population must be collected
<i>which will regard themselves as a community</i>; and two essential elements
are necessary to the building up, moral growth, and stability of such a collection
of people, namely, a church and a school-house.” *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I can safely say that it is only necessary to make <i>comfortable homes</i> in
order to procure families, that will afford labourers of the best kind. A
large manufacturing establishment located anywhere in the State, away
from a town and in a healthy situation, will soon collect around it a population
who, however poor, with proper moral restraints thrown around
them, will soon develope all the elements of good society. Self-respect
and attachment to the place will soon find their way into the minds of such,
while intelligence, morality, and well directed industry, <i>will not fail to
acquire position</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>What the poor people of Edgefield, Barnwell, and Lexington
districts needed was, in the first place, to be led “to
regard themselves as a community;” for this purpose the
nuclei of “a church and a schoolhouse” are declared to be
essential, to which must be added, such other stimulants to
improvement as “singing and writing schools, itinerant
lecturers,” etc., etc. In short, the power of obtaining, as
the result of their labour, “the necessaries of life,” “the
usual luxuries of country life,” or, in two words, which cover
and include church, school, music and lecture, as well as
bread, cleanliness, luxuries and necessities, “comfortable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
homes.” It was simply by making possible to them what
before had not been possible, the essential conditions of a
comfortable civilized home, that Mr. Gregg was enabled in
a few years to announce, as he did, that, “from extreme
poverty and want, they have become a thrifty, happy, and
contented people.”</p>

<p>The present system of American slavery, notwithstanding
the enormous advantages of wealth which the cotton monopoly
is supposed to offer, prevents the people at large from having
“comfortable homes,” in the sense intended by Mr. Gregg.
For nine-tenths of the citizens, comfortable homes, as the
words would be understood by the mass of citizens of the
North and of England, as well as by Mr. Gregg, are, under
present arrangements, out of the question.</p>

<p>Examine almost any rural district of the South, study its
history, and this will be as evident as it was to Mr. Gregg in
the case of those to which his attention was especially called.
These, to be sure, contained, probably, a large proportion of
very poor soil. But how is it in a district of entirely rich
soil? Suppose it to be of twenty square miles, with a
population of six hundred, all told, and with an ordinarily
convenient access by river navigation to market. The whole
of the available cotton land in this case will probably be
owned by three or four men, and on these men the demand
for cotton will have had, let us suppose, its full effect. Their
tillage land will be comparatively well cultivated. Their
houses will be comfortable, their furniture and their food
luxurious. They will, moreover, not only have secured the best
land on which to apply their labour, but the best brute force, the
best tools, and the best machinery for ginning and pressing,
all superintended by the best class of overseers. The cotton
of each will be shipped at the best season, perhaps all at
once, on a boat, or by trains expressly engaged at the lowest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
rates of freight. It will everywhere receive special attention
and care, because it forms together a parcel of great value.
The merchants will watch the markets closely to get the
best prices for it, and when sold the cash returns to each
proprietor will be enormously large. As the expenses of
raising and marketing cotton are in inverse ratio to the
number of hands employed, planters nearly always immediately
reinvest their surplus funds in slaves; and as there
is a sufficient number of large capitalists engaged in cotton-growing
to make a strong competition for the limited
number of slaves which the breeding States can supply, it is
evident that the price of a slave will always be as high as the
product of his labour, under the best management, on the
most valuable land, and with every economical advantage
which money can procure, will warrant.</p>

<p>But suppose that there are in the district besides these
three or four large planters, their families and their slaves,
a certain number of whites who do not own slaves. The
fact of their being non-slaveholders is evidence that they
are as yet without capital, in this case one of two tendencies
must soon be developed. Either being stimulated by the
high price of cotton they will grow industrious, will accumulate
capital and purchase slaves, and owning slaves will
require a larger amount of land upon which to work them
than they require for their own labour alone, thus being
led to buy out one of the other planters, or to move elsewhere
themselves before they have acquired an established
improvement of character from their prosperity; or, secondly,
they will not purchase slaves, but either expend currently
for their own comfort, or hoard the results of their labour.
If they hoard they will acquire no increase of comfort or improvement
of character on account of the demand. If they
spend all their earnings, these will not be sufficient, however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
profitable their cotton culture may be supposed, to purchase
luxuries much superior to those furnished to the slaves of
the planters, because the local demand, being limited to
some fifty white families, in the whole district of twenty
square miles, is not enough to draw luxuries to the neighbourhood,
unless they are brought by special order, and at
great expense from the nearest shipping port. Nor is it
possible for such a small number of whites to maintain a
church or a newspaper, nor yet a school, unless it is one
established by a planter, or two or three planters, and really
of a private and very expensive character.</p>

<p>Suppose, again, another district in which either the land is
generally less productive or the market less easy of access
than in the last, or that both is the case. The stimulus of
the cotton demand is, of course, proportionately lessened. In
this case, equally with the last, the richest soils, and those
most convenient to the river or the railroad, if there happens
to be much choice in this respect, will assuredly be possessed
by the largest capitalists, that is, the largest slaveholders,
who may nevertheless be men of but moderate wealth and
limited information. If so, their standard of comfort will yet
be low, and their demand will consequently take effect very
slowly in increasing the means of comfort, and rendering
facilities for obtaining instruction more accessible to their
neighbours. But suppose, notwithstanding the disadvantages
of the district in its distance from market, that their sales of
cotton, the sole export of the district, are very profitable, and
that the demand for cotton is constantly increasing. A
similar condition with regard to the chief export of a free
labour community would inevitably tend to foster the intelligence
and industry of a large number of people. It has this
effect with only a very limited number of the inhabitants of a
plantation district consisting in large part as they must of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
slaves. These labourers may be driven to work harder, and
may be furnished with better tools for the purpose of increasing
the value of cotton which is to be exchanged for the
luxuries which the planter is learning to demand for himself,
but it is for himself and for his family alone that these
luxuries will be demanded. The wages—or means of demanding
home comfort—of the workmen are not at all
influenced by the cotton demand: the effect, therefore, in enlarging
and cheapening the local supply of the means of home
comfort will be almost inappreciable, while the impulse generated
in the planter’s mind is almost wholly directed toward
increasing the cotton crop through the labour of his slaves
alone. His demand upon the whites of the district is not
materially enlarged in any way. The slave population of the
district will be increased in number, and its labour more
energetically directed, and soon the planters will find the soil
they possess growing less productive from their increasing
drafts upon it. There is plenty of rich unoccupied land to
be had for a dollar an acre a few hundred miles to the West,
still it is no trifling matter to move all the stock, human,
equine, and bovine, and all the implements and machinery of
a large plantation. Hence, at the same time, perhaps, with
an importation from Virginia of purchased slaves, there will
be an active demand among the slaveholders for all the remaining
land in the district on which cotton can be profitably
grown. Then sooner or later, and with a rapidity proportionate
to the effect of the cotton demand, the white population
of the district divides, one part, consisting of a few
slaveholders, obtains possession of all the valuable cotton
land, and monopolizes for a few white families all the advantages
of the cotton demand. A second part removes with its
slaves, if it possess any, from the district, while a third continues
to occupy the sand hills, or sometimes perhaps takes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
possession of the exhausted land which has been vacated by
the large planters, because they, with all their superior skill
and advantages of capital, could not cultivate it longer with
profit.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The population of the district, then, will consist of the
large landowners and slaveowners, who are now so few in
number as to be unnoticeable either as producers or consumers;
of their slaves, who are producers but not consumers
(to any important extent), and of this forlorn hope of poor
whites, who are, in the eyes of the commercial world, neither
producers nor consumers. The contemplation from a distance
of their condition, is a part of the price which is paid by those
who hold slavery to be justifiable on the ground that it maintains
a race of gentlemen. Some occasionally flinch for a
moment, in observing it, and vainly urge that something
should be done to render it less appalling. Touching their
ignorance, for instance, said Governor Seabrooke of South
Carolina, addressing the Legislature of that State, years
ago:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Education has been provided by the Legislature, but for one class of
the citizens of the State, which is the wealthy class. For the middle and
poorer classes of society it has done nothing, since no organized system
has been adopted for that purpose. You have appropriated seventy-five
thousand dollars annually to free schools; but, under the present mode of
applying it, that liberality is really the profusion of the prodigal, rather
than the judicious generosity which confers real benefit. The few who
are educated at public expense in those excellent and truly useful institutions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
the Arsenal and Citadel Academies [military schools], form almost
the only exception to the truth of this remark. Ten years ago, twenty
thousand adults, besides children, were unable to read or write, in South
Carolina. Has our free-school system dispelled any of this ignorance?
Are there not any reasonable fears to be entertained that the number has
increased since that period?”</p>
</div>

<p>Since then, Governor Adams, in another message to the
South Carolina Legislature, vainly urging the appointment of
a superintendent of popular education, said:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Make, at least, this effort, and if it results in nothing—if, in consequence
of insurmountable difficulties in our condition, no improvement
can be made on the present system, and the poor of the land are hopelessly
doomed to ignorance, poverty, and crime—you will, at least, feel
conscious of having done your duty, and the public anxiety on the subject
will be quieted.”</p>
</div>

<p>It is not unnatural that there should be some anxiety with
at least that portion of the public not accustomed to look at
public affairs in the large way of South Carolina legislators,
when the travelling agent of a religious tract society can read
from his diary in a church in Charleston, such a record as
this:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Visited sixty families, numbering two hundred and twenty-one souls
over ten years of age; only twenty-three could read, and seventeen write.
Forty-one families destitute of the Bible. Average of their going to
church, once in seven years. Several, between thirty and forty-five years
old, had heard but one or two sermons in their lives. Some grown-up
youths had never heard a sermon or prayer, until my visit, and did not
know of such a being as the Saviour; and boys and girls, from ten to fifteen
years old, did not know who made them. All of one family rushed away
when I knelt to pray, to a neighbour’s, begging them to tell what I meant
by it. Other families fell on their faces, instead of kneeling.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The following is written by a gentleman, “whose name,”
says the editor of De Bow’s “Review,” “has long been illustrious
for the services he has rendered to the South.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“All of you must be aware of the condition of the class of people I
allude to. What progress have they made in the last hundred years, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
what is to be their future condition, unless some mode of employment be
devised to improve it? A noble race of people! reduced to a condition
but little above the wild Indian of the forest, or the European gipsy,
without education, and, in many instances, unable to procure the food
necessary to develop the natural man. They seem to be the only class of
people in our State who are not disposed to emigrate to other countries,
while our wealthy and intelligent citizens are leaving us by scores, taking
with them the treasures which have been accumulated by mercantile thrift,
as well as by the growth of cotton and the consequent exhaustion of
the soil.”</p>
</div>

<p>Says Governor Hammond, also of South Carolina, in an
address before the South Carolina Institute:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“According to the best calculations which, in the absence of statistic
facts, can be made, it is believed that, of the 300,000 <i>white</i> inhabitants of
South Carolina, there are not less than 50,000, whose industry, such as it
is, and compensated as it is, is not, in the present condition of things, and
does not promise, hereafter, to be, adequate to procure them, honestly,
such a support as every white person in this country is and feels himself
entitled to.</p>

<p>“Some cannot be said to work at all. They obtain a precarious subsistence
by occasional jobs, by hunting, by fishing, sometimes by plundering
fields or folds, and, too often, by what is, in its effects, far worse—trading
with slaves, and seducing them to plunder for their benefit.”</p>
</div>

<p>In another part of the same address, Governor Hammond
says, that “$18 or, at the most $19, will cover the whole
necessary annual cost of a full supply of wholesome and
palatable food, purchased in the market;” meaning, generally,
in South Carolina. From a comparison of these two extracts,
it will be evident that $19 per annum is high wages for the
labour of one-sixth of all the white population of South
Carolina—and that one-sixth exclusive of the classes not
obliged to labour for their living.</p>

<p>South Carolina affords the fairest example of the tendency
of the Southern policy, because it is the oldest cotton State,
and because slavery has been longest and most strongly and
completely established there. But the same laws are seen in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
operation leading to the same sure results everywhere. Some
carefully compiled statistics of the seaboard district of Georgia
will be found in <a href="#Page_385">Appendix (D)</a>, showing the comparative condition
of the people in the rich sea-island counties, and those
in their rear, the latter consisting in large proportion of poor
or worn-out lands. I recapitulate here the more exact of
these statistics:—</p>

<p><i>Population.</i>—A large majority of the whole white population
resides within the barren counties, of which the slave
population is less than one-fourteenth that of the aggregate
slave population of the whole.</p>

<p><i>Wealth.</i>—The personal estate of the whites of these upper
counties is, on an average, less than one-sixth that of the
others.</p>

<p><i>Education.</i>—As the wealthy are independent of public
schools, the means of education are scarcely more available
for those who are not rich in one than the other, the school-houses
being, on an average, ten and a half miles apart in the
less populous, thirteen and three-quarters miles apart in the
more populous.</p>

<p><i>Religion.</i>—It is widely otherwise as to churches. In the
planting counties, there is a house of worship for every
twenty-nine white families; in the poor white counties, one
for every one hundred and sixty-two white families. Notwithstanding
the fact, that to accommodate all, the latter
should be six times as large, their average value is less than
one-tenth that of the others; the one being eight hundred
and ninety-eight dollars, the other eighty-nine dollars.</p>

<p><i>Commerce.</i>—So wholly do the planters, in whose hands
is the wealth, depend on their factors for direct supplies from
without, the capital invested in trade, in the coast counties, is
but thirty-seven and a half cents to each inhabitant, and in
the upper counties it is but one dollar and fifty cents. From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
the remarks on temperance it would seem that the most of
this capital must be held in the form of whiskey. One
“store” in Liberty county, which I myself entered, contained,
so far as I could see, nothing but casks, demijohns, decanters,
a box of coffee, a case of tobacco, and some powder and lead;
and I believe that nine-tenths of the stock in trade referred
to in these statistics is of this character. It was mentioned to
me by a gentleman who had examined this district with a
commercial purpose, that, off the plantations, there was no
money in the country—almost literally, no money. The
dealings even of the merchants or tradesmen seemed to be
entirely by barter. He believed there were many full-grown
men who had never seen so much as a dollar in money in
their lives.</p>

<p>The following is a graphic sketch by a native Georgian of
the present appearance of what was once the most productive
cotton land of the State:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The classic hut occupied a lovely spot, overshadowed by majestic
hickories, towering poplars, and strong-armed oaks. The little plain on
which it stood was terminated, at the distance of about fifty feet from the
door, by the brow of a hill, which descended rather abruptly to a noble
spring, that gushed joyously forth from among the roots of a stately beech,
at its foot. The stream from this fountain scarcely burst into view, before
it hid itself in the dark shade of a field of cane, which overspread the dale
through which it flowed, and marked its windings, until it turned from
sight, among vine-covered hills, at a distance far beyond that to which the
eye could have traced it, without the help of its evergreen belt. A remark
of the captain’s, as we viewed this lovely country, will give the reader my
apology for the minuteness of the foregoing description: ‘These lands,’
said he, ‘will never wear out. Where they lie level, they will be just as
good, fifty years hence, as they are now.’ Forty-two years afterwards, I
visited the spot on which he stood when he made the remark. The sun
poured his whole strength upon the bald hill which once supported the
sequestered school-house; many a deep-washed gully met at a sickly bog,
where had gushed the limpid fountain; a dying willow rose from the soil
which had nourished the venerable beech; flocks wandered among the
dwarf pines, and cropped a scanty meal from the vale where the rich cane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
had bowed and rustled to every breeze, and all around was barren, dreary,
and cheerless.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>
</div>

<p>I will quote from graver authority: Fenner’s Southern
Medical Reports:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The native soil of Middle Georgia is a rich argillaceous loam, resting
on a firm clay foundation. In some of the richer counties, nearly all the
lands have been cut down, and appropriated to tillage; a large maximum of
which have been worn out, leaving a desolate picture for the traveller to
behold. Decaying tenements, red, old hills, stripped of their native growth
and virgin soil, and washed into deep gullies, with here and there patches
of Bermuda grass and stunted pine shrubs, struggling for subsistence on
what was once one of the richest soils in America.”</p>
</div>

<p>Let us go on to Alabama, which was admitted as a State of
the Union only so long ago as 1818.</p>

<p>In an address before the Chunnenuggee Horticultural
Society, by Hon. C. C. Clay, Jr., reported by the author in
De Bow’s “Review,” December, 1815, I find the following
passage. I need add not a word to it to show how the
political experiment of the Carolinas, and Georgia, is being
repeated to the same cursed result in young Alabama. The
author, it is fair to say, is devoted to the sustentation of
Slavery, and would not, for the world, be suspected of favouring
any scheme for arresting this havoc of wealth, further
than by chemical science:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I can show you, with sorrow, in the older portions of Alabama, and in
my native county of Madison, the sad memorials of the artless and exhausting
culture of cotton. Our small planters, after taking the cream off their
lands, unable to restore them by rest, manures, or otherwise, are going
further west and south, in search of other virgin lands, which they may
and will despoil and impoverish in like manner. <i>Our wealthier planters,
with greater means and no more skill, are buying out their poorer neighbours,
extending their plantations, and adding to their slave force. The wealthy few,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
who are able to live on smaller profits, and to give their blasted fields some
rest, are thus pushing off the many, who are merely independent</i>.</p>

<p>“Of the twenty millions of dollars annually realized from the sales of the
cotton crop of Alabama, nearly all not expended in supporting the producers
is reinvested in land and negroes. Thus the white population has decreased,
and the slave increased, almost <i>pari passu</i> in several counties of our State.
In 1825, Madison county cast about 3,000 votes; now she cannot cast
exceeding 2,300. <i>In traversing that county one will discover numerous farm-houses,
once the abode of industrious and intelligent freemen, now occupied by
slaves, or tenantless, deserted, and dilapidated; he will observe fields, once
fertile, now unfenced, abandoned, and covered with those evil harbingers—fox-tail
and broom-sedge; he will see the moss growing on the mouldering walls
of once thrifty villages: and will find ‘one only master grasps the whole
domain’ that once furnished happy homes for a dozen white families. Indeed,
a country in its infancy, where, fifty years ago, scarce a forest tree had been
felled by the axe of the pioneer is already exhibiting the painful signs of
senility and decay apparent in Virginia and the Carolinas; the freshness of
its agricultural glory is gone; the vigour of its youth is extinct, and the spirit
of desolation seems brooding over it.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>What inducement has capital in railroads or shops or books
or tools to move into districts like this, or which are to become
like this? Why, rather, I shall be asked, does it not withdraw
more completely? Why do not all, who are able,
remove from a region so desolate? Why was not its impoverishment
more complete, more simultaneous? How is it
that any slaveholders yet remain? The “venerable Edmund
Ruffin,” president of the Virginia State Agricultural Society,
shall answer:<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The causes are not all in action at once, and in equal progress. The
labours of exhausting culture, also, are necessarily suspended as each of the
cultivators’ fields is successively worn out. And when tillage so ceases,
and any space is thus left at rest, nature immediately goes to work to
recruit and replace as much as possible of the wasted fertility, until another
destroyer, after many years, shall return, again to waste, and in much
shorter time than before, the smaller stock of fertility so renewed. Thus
the whole territory, so scourged, is not destroyed at one operation. But
though these changes and partial recoveries are continually, to some extent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
counteracting the labours for destruction, still the latter work is in general
progress. It may require (as it did in my native region) more than two
hundred years, from the first settlement, to reach the lowest degradation.
But that final result is not the less certainly to be produced by the continued
action of the causes.”</p>
</div>

<p>As to the extent to which the process is carried, Mr. Gregg
says:<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I think it would be within bounds to assume that the planting capital
withdrawn within that period [the last twenty-five years] would, judiciously
applied, have drained every acre of swamp land in South Carolina, besides
resuscitating the old, worn-out land, and doubling the crops—thus more
than quadrupling the productive power of the agriculture of the State.”</p>
</div>

<p>It would be consoling to hope that this planters’ capital in
the new region to which it is driven were used to better
results. Does the average condition of the people of western
Louisiana and Texas, as I have exhibited it to the reader in a
former chapter, justify such a hope? When we consider the
form in which this capital exists, and the change in the mode
of its investment which is accomplished when it is transferred
from South Carolina, we perceive why it does not.</p>

<p>If we are told that the value of one hundred thousand
dollars has been recently transferred from Massachusetts to a
certain young township of Illinois, we reasonably infer that
the people of this township will be considerably benefited
thereby. We think what an excellent saw mill and grist
mill, what an assortment of wares, what a good inn, what a
good school, what fine breeding stock, what excellent seeds
and fruit trees, what superior machinery and implements,
they will be able to obtain there now; and we know that some
of these or other sources of profit, convenience, and comfort to
a neighbourhood, are almost certain to exist in all capital
so transferred. In the capital transferred from South Carolina,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
there is no such virtue—none of consequence. In a
hundred thousand dollars of it there will not be found a single
mill, nor a waggon load of “store goods;” it will hardly introduce
to the neighbourhood whither it goes a single improvement,
convenience, or comfort. At least ninety thousand
dollars of it will consist in slaves, and if their owners go with
them it is hard to see in what respect their real home comfort
is greater.</p>

<p>We must admit, it is true, that they are generally better
satisfied, else this transfer would not be so unremitting as it
is. The motive is the same at the North as at the South,
the prospect of a better interest from the capital, and if this
did not exist it would not be transferred. Let us suppose
that, at starting, the ends of the capitalist are obtained equally
in both cases, that a sale of produce is made, bringing in cash
twenty thousand dollars; suppose that five thousand dollars of
this is used in each case for the home comfort of the owners,
and that as much immediate comfort is attainable with it in
the one case as in the other. What, then, is done with the
fifteen thousand dollars? At the South, it goes to pay for a
farther transfer of slaves purchased in the East, a trifle also
for new tools. At the North, nearly all of it will go to improvement
of machinery of some kind, machinery of transfer
or trade, if not of manufacture, to the improvement of the productive
value of whatever the original capital had been invested
in, much of it to the remuneration of talent, which is thus
enabled to be employed for the benefit of many people other
than these capitalists—for the home comfort of many people.
If five thousand dollars purchased no more comfort in the one
case than the other, at starting, in a few years it will purchase
double as much. For the fifteen thousand dollars which has
gone East in the one case to pay for more labour, will, in the
other, have procured good roads and cheap transportation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
comforts, or shops and machinery, and thus the cheap manufacture
of comforts on the spot where they are demanded. But
they who sell the reinforcement of slaves, and to whom comes
the fifteen thousand dollars, do they have no increase of home
comfort? Taking into consideration the gradual destruction
of all the elements of home comfort which the rearing and
holding of those slaves has occasioned in the district from
which they are sold, it may be doubtful if, in the end, they do.
Whither, then, does this capital go? The money comes to the
country from those who buy cotton, and somebody must have
a benefit of it. Who? Every one at the South says, when
you ask this, it is the Northern merchant, who, in the end,
gets it into his own hands, and it is only him and his whom it
benefits. Mr. Gregg apparently believes this. He says, after
the sentence last quoted from him, describing the transfer of
capital to the West from South Carolina:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But this is not all. Let us look for a moment at the course of things
among our mercantile classes. We shall not have to go much further back
than twenty-five years to count up twenty-five millions of capital accumulated
in Charleston, and which has left us with its enterprising owners, who
have principally located in northern cities. This sum would build factories
enough to spin and weave every pound of cotton made in the State, besides
making railroads to intersect every portion of the up-country, giving business
facilities to the remotest points.”</p>
</div>

<p>How comes this capital, the return made by the world
for the cotton of the South, to be so largely in the hands of
Northern men? The true answer is, that what these get is
simply their fair commercial remuneration for the trouble of
transporting cotton, transporting money, transporting the total
amount of home comfort, little as it is, which the South gets
for its cotton, from one part of the country to the other (chiefly
cotton to the coast, and goods returned instead of money from
the coast to the plantations), and for the enormous risks and
advances of capital which are required in dealing with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
South. Is this service over paid? If so, why do not the
planters transfer capital and energy to it from the plantations?
It is not so. Dispersed and costly labour makes the cost of
trade or transfer enormous (as it does the cost of cotton producing).
It is only when this wealth is transferred to the
Free States or to Europe that it gives great results to human
comfort and becomes of great value. The South, as a whole,
has at present no advantage from cotton, even planters but
little. The chief result of the demand for it, as far as they
are concerned, is to give a fictitious value to slaves.</p>

<p>Throughout the South-west I found men, who either told
me themselves, or of whom it was said by others, that they
settled where I found them, ten or fifteen years ago, with
scarcely any property beyond half a dozen negroes, who were
then indeed heavily in debt, but who were now quite rich men,
having from twenty to fifty negroes. Nor is this at all surprising,
when it is considered that cotton costs nothing but
labour, the value of the land, however rich, being too inconsiderable
to be taken into account, and that the price of cotton
has doubled in ten years. But in what else beside negroes
were these rich men better off than when they called themselves
poor? Their real comfort, unless in the sense of
security against extreme want, or immunity from the necessity
of personal labour to sustain life, could scarcely have been
increased in the least. There was, at any rate, the same
bacon and corn, the same slough of a waggon channel
through the forest, the same bare walls in their dwellings,
the same absence of taste and art and literature, the same
distance from schools and churches and educated advisers,
and—on account of the distance of tolerable mechanics, and
the difficulty of moving without destruction, through such a
rough country, anything elaborate or finely finished—the
same make-shift furniture. There were, to be sure, ploughs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
and hoes, and gins and presses, and there were scores of very
“likely negroes.” Whoever sold such of these negroes as
had been bought must have been the richer, it will be said.
But let us see.</p>

<p>The following picture of the condition of Virginia, the
great breeding ground of slaves, is drawn by the last governor
of that State, Henry A. Wise. It was addressed to a
Virginia audience, who testified to its truthfulness.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You have had no commerce, no mining, no manufactures.</p>

<p>“You have relied alone on the single power of agriculture—and such
agriculture! Your sedge-patches outshine the sun. Your inattention to
your only source of wealth has scared the very bosom of mother earth.
Instead of having to feed cattle on a thousand hills, you have had to chase
the stump-tailed steer through the sedge-patches to procure a tough beef-steak.</p>

<p>“The present condition of things has existed too long in Virginia. The
landlord has skinned the tenant, and the tenant has skinned the land, until
all have grown poor together. I have heard a story—I will not locate it
here or there—about the condition of the prosperity of our agriculture. I
was told by a gentleman in Washington, not long ago, that he was travelling
in a county not a hundred miles from this place, and overtook one of
our citizens on horseback, with, perhaps, a bag of hay for a saddle, without
stirrups, and the leading line for a bridle, and he said: ‘Stranger, whose
house is that?’ ‘It is mine,’ was the reply. They came to another.
‘Whose house is that?’ ‘Mine, too, stranger.’ To a third: ‘And whose
house is that?’ ‘That’s mine, too, stranger; but don’t suppose that I’m
so darned poor as to own all the land about here.’”</p>
</div>

<p>But more to the purpose is the following statement of “the
venerable Edmund Ruffin,” President of the Virginia Agricultural
Society.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A gang of slaves on a farm will increase to four times their original
number in thirty or forty years. If a farmer is only able to feed and
maintain his slaves, their increase in value may double the whole of his
capital originally invested in farming before he closes the term of an ordinary
life. But few farms are able to support this increasing expense, and
also furnish the necessary supplies to the family of the owner; whence
very many owners of large estates, in lands and negroes, are throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
their lives too poor to enjoy the comforts of life, or to incur the expenses
necessary to improve their unprofitable farming. A man so situated may
be said to be a slave to his own slaves. If the owner is industrious and
frugal, he may be able to support the increasing numbers of his slaves, and
to bequeath them undiminished to his children. But the income of few
persons increases as fast as their slaves, and, if not, the consequence must
be that some of them will be sold, that the others may be supported, and
the sale of more is perhaps afterwards compelled to pay debts incurred in
striving to put off that dreaded alternative. The slave at first almost
starves his master, and at last is eaten by him—at least, he is exchanged
for his value in food.”</p>
</div>

<p>A large proportion of the negroes sold to these South-western
planters, then, had probably been bought by traders at
forced sales in the older States, sales forced by merchants who
had supplied the previous owners of the negroes, and who
had given them credit, not on account of the productive
value of their property as then situated, but in view of its
cash value for sale, that is, of the value which it would
realize when applied to cotton on the new soils of the South-west.</p>

<p>The planters of the South-west are then, in fact, supplying
the deficit of Eastern production, taking their pay almost
entirely in negroes. The free West fills the deficit of the
free Eastern cereal production, but takes its pay in the manufactured
goods, the fish, the oil, the butter, and the importations
of the free East.</p>

<p>Virginia planters owning twenty to forty slaves, and nominally
worth as many thousand dollars, often seem to live
generously; but according to Northern standards, I do not
think that the comforts and advantages for a rationally happy
life, which they possess, compare with those of the average
of Northern farmers of half that wealth. When they do,
they must be either supplying slaves for the new cotton fields
or living on credit—credit based on an anticipation of supplying
that market.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span></p>

<p>Of course it cannot be maintained that no one, while living
at the South, is actually richer from the effects of the cotton
demand. There are a great many very wealthy men at the
South, and of planters, as well as land dealers, negro dealers,
and general merchants, but, except in or near those towns
which are, practically, colonies of free labour, having constant
direct communication and intimate relationship with free
countries, the wealth of these more fortunate people secures
to them but a small proportion of the advantages which
belong to the same nominal wealth anywhere in the Free
States, while their number is so small that they must be
held of no account at all in estimating the condition of the
people, when it is compared with the number of those who are
exceedingly destitute, and at whose expense, quite as much
as at the expense of their slaves, the wealth of the richer class
has been accumulated.</p>

<p>This cannot be rightly deemed extravagant or unjust language.
I should not use it if I did not feel satisfied that it
was warranted, not only by my own personal observations,
but by the testimony of persons whose regard for the pride
of the South, whose sympathy with wealthy planters, and
whose disposition not to underrate the good results of slavery,
if not more sincere than mine, is more certain not to be
doubted. I quote, for instance, a single passage from the
observations of Mr. Russell, an English gentleman, who,
travelling with a special view of studying the agricultural
condition and prospects of the country, was, nevertheless, so
much limited in time that he was obliged to trust in a great
degree to the observations of planters for his facts.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In travelling through a fertile district in any of the Southern States,
the appearance of things forms a great contrast to that in similar districts in
the Free States. During two days’ sail on the Alabama river from Mobile
to Montgomery, I did not see so many houses standing together in any one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
spot as could be dignified with the appellation of village:<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> but I may possibly
have passed some at night. There were many places where cotton
was shipped and provisions were landed, still there were no signs of enterprise
to indicate that we were in the heart of a rich cotton region. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;
The planters supply themselves directly through agents in the large
towns, and comparatively little of the money drawn for the cotton crop is
spent in the Southern States. Many of the planters spend their incomes
by travelling with their families in the Northern States or in Europe during
the summer, and a large sum is required to pay the hog-raiser in Ohio,
the mule-breeder in Kentucky, and, above all, the Northern capitalists who
have vast sums of money on mortgage over the estates. <i>Dr. Cloud, the
editor of the Cotton Plant</i> [Alabama], assured me that after all these items
are paid out of the money received for the whole cotton crop and sugar
crops of the South, there did not remain one-fourth part of it to be spent
in the Southern States. Hence, the Slave States soon obtain a comparatively
stationary condition, and, further, the progress they make is in
proportion to the increase of freemen, whose labour is rendered comparatively
unproductive, seeing that the most fertile land is occupied by
slaveholders.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>
</div>

<p>I questioned the agent of a large land speculation in
Mississippi, a Southerner by birth, with regard to the success
of small farmers. In reply he made the following statement,
allowing me to take notes of it, understanding they were for
publication:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The majority of our purchasers have been men without capital. To
such we usually sell one hundred and sixty acres of land, at from two to
three dollars an acre, the agreement being to pay in one, two, and three
years, with six per cent. interest. It is very rare that the payments are
made when due, and much the largest proportion of this class fail even to
pay their interest punctually. Many fail altogether, and quit their farms
in about ten years. When crops are generally good, and planters in the
same neighbourhood make seven bales to a hand, poor people will not
make over two bales, with their whole family. There is —— ——, in
—— county, for instance. We sold him one hundred and sixty acres of
land in 1843. He has a family of good-sized boys—young men now. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
ten years he was never able to pay his interest. He sold from two to four
bales a year, but he did not get much for it, and after taking out the cost of
bagging and rope, and ginning and pressing, he scarcely ever had two hundred
dollars a year coming to him, of which he had to pay his store bills,
chiefly for coffee and molasses, sometimes a little clothing—some years
none at all. They made their own cloth mostly in the house, but bought
sheeting sometimes. He has made one payment on the principal, from a
sale of hogs. Almost the only poor people who have kept up to their
agreement have been some near ——, since the cotton factory was started
there. It is wonderful what a difference that has made, though it’s but a
picayune affair. People who have no negroes in this country generally
raise corn enough to bread them through the year, and have hogs enough
ranging in the swamps to supply them with bacon. They do not often
buy anything except coffee and molasses and tobacco. They are not
generally drunkards, but the men will spend all the money they may have
and get gloriously drunk once or twice a year, at elections or at court
time, when they go to the county town. I think that two bales of cotton
a year is as much as is generally made by people who do not own negroes.
They are doing well if they net over fifty dollars a year from their labour,
besides supplying themselves with corn. A real smart man, who tends his
crop well, and who knows how it ought to be managed, can make five
bales, almost always. Five bales are worth two hundred and fifty dollars,
but it’s very rare that a white man makes that. They have not got the right
kind of tools, and they don’t know how. Their crops are never half tended.
If folks generally tended their crops as some do, there would be more than
twice as much cotton raised as there is.”</p>
</div>

<p>With regard to the enlargement of estates by successful
planters, having stated what were my impressions, the same
gentleman replied that I was entirely right, and gave an
instance, as follows, from his personal knowledge:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“J. B. moved into —— county within my recollection. He has bought
out, one after another, and mainly since 1850, more than twenty small
landowners, some of them small slaveholders, and they have moved away
from the vicinity. I do not know how many negroes he has now, but
several hundred, certainly. His surplus must have averaged twenty
thousand dollars a year for several years, and, as far as I know, the whole
is expended in purchasing negroes or land. He spends no money for
anything else in the county, I am sure. It is a common thing to hear a man
say, ‘J. B. has bought up next to me, and I shall have to quit soon.’ He
never gets the land alongside of a man that within two years he does not
buy him out. In the last ten years I know of but one exception, and that
is a man who has shot two of B.’s niggers who were stealing his corn.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
This man swears he won’t sell at any price, and that he will shoot any of
J. B.’s niggers whom he catches coming on his place. B.’s niggers are
afraid of him, and let him alone. J. B. will pay more for land than its
worth to anybody else, and his negroes are such thieves that nobody
can live in comfort on any place adjoining one of his. There are two
other men in the county who are constantly buying up the land around
there. The white population of the county is diminishing, and the trade of
the place [the county town] is not so good as it was ten years ago.”</p>
</div>

<p>The following is an extract from a letter written by a
worthy farmer of Illinois, whose name and address is in my
possession, and who is deemed by those who have known him
for many years a sound trustworthy man:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What might be made of this country if the people were free, and the
labourer everywhere owned the land, one may speculate upon; and when
he sees the homes of Yankees who go thither often with small means, and
make old worn-out places blossom and bloom, he begins to suspect that
there is something in men as well as in climate.</p>

<p>“I now come to speak of the wealth of the people of the South-western
Slave States, and, for fear I may be thought to exaggerate, I here say I
will not tell the whole truth. I’ll keep some back for another time.
Now, men who go through on boats and cars, and stop in cities and large
hotels, know nothing to what I do—I who have gone among the people of
every class, I who have stayed with them hundreds of nights, Sundays and
all, and gone to meetings and frolics, and travelled hours in the woods,
where sometimes there was a road, and sometimes not, trying to find a
place to stay over night—and, having visited more than a thousand plantations,
and slept and eat in I know not how many hovels, and talked with
them all, and, if I choose, can talk precisely as they do, and they wouldn’t
suspect I was born up North—I say, I think I ought to know something
about them.</p>

<p>“The impression which one gets on going South is the general dilapidation
or carelessness which appears, even upon some of the best plantations.
The nice white houses so common at the North, even in the
remotest agricultural districts, with green blinds, with clean door-yards,
and well kept shrubbery, snug barns, green meadows, and corner school-houses,
are nowhere seen. The furniture of the houses is of the commonest
description; and to make short work with it, I estimate that there
are not decent chairs enough in the whole South to give half a set to
each family. For there are to-day, and there have been for every day for
more than ten years past, more than 30,000 people in Tennessee alone, who
have not a foot of land or a bit of work to do. I am speaking of whites,
and not of negroes at all. A bushel of corn-meal, a side of bacon, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
little coffee, will be all that a family of this class can ever expect to get
beforehand, and it is often they get neither coffee nor bacon. If they
have a cow, and she ‘comes up,’ they may have milk, but as for butter,
some have heard of it, some have seen it, few have eaten it. And the fact
is, many, yes, many who own from two to five slaves, are little better off. I
stayed with a man who had fifteen slaves and 400 acres of land, where he
had lived forty years, and his house was not worth fifty cents; what my
fare was you may guess. I have seen hundreds of families living in log
cabins, ten or twelve feet square, where the children run around as naked
as ever they were born, and a bedstead or chair was not in the house, and
never will be. I have seen the children eat wheat and grass, growing
in the field. I have seen them eat dirt. I saw children here on my
own place, in Southern Illinois, last year, eat dirt, they were so hungry.
Southern Illinois has been a city of refuge for the poor people of the Slave
States. Folks thought Humboldt told a big story when he gave an account
of the clay-eating Indians of South America. Of course where
poverty is so general, and where the slaves are few, the slaves cannot fare
much worse than their masters. It is generally said by the people of the
Slave States that they prefer corn bread, but, place the two kinds before
them, and you will see which they like best. No class of people like
corn bread, and no people, as a general thing, are worth much who can get
nothing else.</p>

<p>“For the most part, the people of these regions manufacture all their
every-day clothing, and their garments look as though they were made
for no other purpose than to keep them warm and to cover their nakedness;
beauty of colouring and propriety in fitting are little regarded. Every
man who is not rich is a shoemaker. Blacksmith-shops are innumerable,
and yet I have sent a boy over eighty miles from shop to shop, and then
did not get a horse shod. Men call themselves gunsmiths, but they only
stock guns. There are carpenters, and cabinet-makers, and chair-makers,
and all this working badly with poor tools. The sum is, there is no real
discipline of mind among them, no real ingenuity, no education, no comfortable
houses, no good victuals, nor do they know how to cook; and when
I go among them, what troubles me most is, they have <i>no grass, no clover,
no hay</i>.</p>

<p>“And yet, as fine and well-disposed men, and as anxious to improve, are
to be found in the South-western States as are to be found anywhere.
They are as honest as men ever are, and they will treat a stranger the best
they know how. The trouble is, the large slaveholders have got all the
good land. There can be no schools, and if the son of a poor man rises
above his condition there is no earthly chance for him. He can only hope
to be a slave-driver, for an office is not his, or he must leave and go to a Free
State. <i>Were there no Free States, the white people of the South would to-day
be slaves.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>I will here call upon just one more witness, whose evidence
I cite at this point, not merely because, in very few words,
having reference to the very heart of the planter’s prosperity,
it practically endorses all I have said, but for another reason
which will presently appear.</p>

<p>First as to the non-slaveholders:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am not aware that the relative number of these two classes has ever
been ascertained in any of the States, but I am satisfied that the non-slaveholders
far outnumber the slaveholders, perhaps by three to one.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
In the more southern portion of this region [‘the South-west,’ of which
Mississippi is the centre], the non-slaveholders possess generally but very
small means, and the land which they possess is almost universally poor,
and so sterile that a scanty subsistence is all that can be derived from its
cultivation, and the more fertile soil, being in the hands of the slaveholders,
must ever remain out of the power of those who have none. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp; And
I lament to say that I have observed of late years that an evident deterioration
is taking place in this part of the population, the younger portion of
it being less educated, less industrious, and. in every point of view, less respectable
than their ancestors.”—<span class="smcap">J. O. B. De Bow</span>, <i>Resources of the South
and West</i>, vol. ii. p. 106.</p>
</div>

<p>Again as to the cotton-planters and slaveholders:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If one unacquainted with the condition of the South-west were told
that the cotton-growing district alone had sold the crop for fifty million
dollars for the last twenty years he would naturally conclude that this
must be the richest community in the world. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp; But what would
be his surprise when told that so far from living in palaces, many of these
planters dwell in habitations of the most primitive construction, and these
so inartificially built as to be incapable of defending the inmates from the
winds and rains of heaven. That instead of any artistical improvement,
this rude dwelling was surrounded by cotton fields, or probably by fields
exhausted, washed into gullies, and abandoned; that instead of canals,
the navigable streams remain unimproved, to the great detriment of
transportation; that the common roads of the country were scarcely passable;
that the edifices erected for the purposes of learning and religion
were frequently built of logs and covered [roofed] with boards.”—<span class="smcap">J. O. B.
De Bow</span>, <i>Resources of the South</i>, vol. ii. p. 113.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span></p>
<p>Do a majority of Northern working men dwell in habitations
having no more elements of comfort, even taking difference
of climate into consideration, than Mr. De Bow ascribes
to the residences of the slaves’ owners? No Northern man
can for a moment hold such an opinion. What, then,
becomes of the theory by which the planters justify slavery
to themselves and recommend it to us? If the ennobling
luxuries which the institution of slavery secures to the
“superior class,” and by which it is supposed to be “qualified
for the higher duties of citizenship,” are, at the most, sugar,
instead of molasses, in its coffee; butter, with its pone;
cabbage, with its bacon, and two sheets to its bed—and the
traveller who goes where I travelled, month after month,
with the same experience, cannot help learning to regard
these as luxuries indeed,—if “freedom from sordid and petty
cares,” and “leisure for intellectual pursuits,” means a condition
approaching in comfort that of the keeper of a lightship
on an outer bar, what is the exact value of such words
as “hospitality,” “generosity,” and “gallantry?” What is
to be understood from phrases in such common use as “high
toned,” “well bred,” “generous,” “hospitable,” and soon,
when used in argument to prove the beneficence of slavery
and to advocate its extension?</p>

<p><i>From De Bow’s Review.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Frederick Law Olmsted, after signalizing himself by two very
wordy volumes, abounding in bitterness and prejudice of every sort, and
misrepresentations upon the ‘Seaboard Slave States,’ finding how profitable
such literature is in a pecuniary point of view, and what a run is being made
upon it thoughout the entire limits of abolitiondom, vouchsafes us now
another volume, entitled a ‘Journey through Texas, or a Saddle-trip on the
South-western Frontier.’ Here, again, the opportunity is too tempting to be
resisted to revile and abuse the men and the society whose open hospitality
he undoubtedly enjoyed, and whom we have no doubt, like every other
of his tribe travelling at the South, he found it convenient at the time to
flatter and approve. We have now grown accustomed to this, and it is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
at all surprising that here and there it is producing its effect in some
violent exhibition of feeling like that displayed by our worthy old friend
Dr. Brewer, of Montgomery county, Maryland, who persistently refuses, on
all occasions, to allow a Yankee even to cross his fields, or like that of
John Randolph, who said in the House, ‘Mr. Speaker, I would not allow
one of my servants to buy as much as a toot-horn from one of these
people.’ *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Somewhat further on, the parties rest for the night. ‘For this the
charge was $1.25 each person, including breakfast and horse-feed.’ At
the end of every page or two our tourist repeats these growlings over
the enormous exactions. It is the refrain from one cover of the book to
the other. What a series of martyrdoms. Could such a journey by any
possibility be made ‘to pay?’ Perhaps, friend traveller, you have heard of
the lavish hospitality of the South, and imagined that people there moved
out upon the high road for the sole purpose of sharing the society which
gentlemen, like yourself, could furnish, believing every arrival to be an
act of special providence! When you offered to pay the woman on
Red River, and ‘feared she was offended by your offering her money for
her hospitality,’ you paid the highest compliment to the South; for heaven
knows you would have had no such apprehension on the banks of the
Connecticut.”</p>
</div>

<p>I cannot but be gratified that so much importance should
have been attached to my earlier volumes as to induce the
Superintendent of the Census to devote to their consideration
a leading article in the first economico-political review of the
country; and I can feel nothing but regret that he should be
obliged to attribute to an unworthy motive even those of my
labours the result of which he does me the honour to designate
as valuable and trustworthy. I have often had occasion
to refer to Mr. De Bow, and, I believe, have always done so
in a manner consistent with the respect which I feel for the
class of men among whom he has had the honourable ambition
to rank himself. That a man, while occupying a position
which properly belongs to the most able and just-minded
statistician in the country, should think it proper to write
under his own name in the manner of which the above extracts
are a sample, about a work which assumes to relate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
calmly and methodically, the result of a personal study of the
condition of the people of a certain State, is a note-worthy
circumstance in illustration of the present political history of
our country. I cite them now, however, chiefly to show what
need there is for a discussion upon which I propose to enter,
myself, little further than is necessary to enable me to clearly
set forth certain facts in their more important significance, the
right of publishing which can hardly be denied me, in view
of the insinuations made by Mr. De Bow, who in this follows
what has got to be a general custom of Southern reviewers and
journalists towards travellers with whose expressed judgments
upon any matter observed within the slave States they differ.
There are numerous homes in the South the memory of which
I cherish tenderly. There are numbers of men in the South
for whom I have a warm admiration, to whom I feel grateful,
whose respect I wish not to lose. There are others for whom
I have a quite different feeling. Of a single individual of
neither class have I spoken in these two volumes, I believe,
by his true name, or in such a manner that he could be recognized,
or his home pointed out by any one who had not
been previously familiar with it and with him, being, as a
rule, careful to so far differ from the actual order of the
events of my journey in narrating them, that facts of private
life could not be readily localized. From this rule I do not
intend now to depart further than is necessary to exhibit the
whole truth of the facts to which I have referred, but since
the charge of ingratitude and indelicacy is publicly made
against me, as it has frequently been of late against better
men on similar grounds, I propose to examine those grounds
in the light of certain actual experiences of myself and others,
and let it be judged whether there must always exist a peculiar
moral obligation upon travellers to be mealy-mouthed
as to the habits of the people of the South, either on account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
of hospitality or in reciprocation of the delicate reserve which,
from the tenor of Mr. De Bow’s remarks, it might be supposed
was habitually exercised in the South with regard to
the habits of their own people. These experiences shall be
both special and general. What immediately follows is of
the former class, but, in the end, it will be found to have a
general significance.</p>

<p>On a hot morning in July a Northern traveller left the
town of Lynchburg, the chief market-town of Virginia tobacco,
and rode eastwardly towards Farmville. Suddenly taken
severely ill, and no house being in sight, he turned from the
road into the shade of the wood, dismounted, reclined against
a sturdy trunk, took an anodyne, which he fortunately had
with him, and at length found relief in sleep. Late in the
day he awoke, somewhat recovered, but with a sharp headache
and much debilitated. He managed, however, to mount,
and rode slowly on to find a shelter for the night. In half
an hour the welcome sight of an old plantation mansion
greeted his eyes. There was a large court, with shade trees
and shrubbery between the road and the house, and in the
corner of this court, facing the road, a small warehouse or
barn, in and around which were a number of negroes moving
casks of tobacco. A white man, evidently their owner, was
superintending their labour, and to him the traveller applied
for lodging for the night.</p>

<p>“We don’t take in strangers.”</p>

<p>The traveller informed the planter of his illness and inability
to ride further.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to try to ride as far as the next house, sir;
we don’t take in travellers here,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Really I don’t feel able. I should not like to put you
to inconvenience, sir, but I am weak and faint. My horse,
too, has eaten nothing since early in the morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span></p>

<p>“Sorry for you, but we have no accommodation for travellers
here,” was the only reply, and the planter stepped to
the other side of a tobacco cask.</p>

<p>The traveller rode on. About half an hour afterwards he
came in sight of another house. It was at a distance from
the road, and to reach it he was obliged to let down and put
up again three different sets of fence-bars. The owner was
not at home, and his wife said that they were not accustomed
to take in strangers. “It was not far to the next house,”
she added, as the traveller hesitated.</p>

<p>He reached, at length, the next house, which proved to
be the residence of another large tobacco planter, who sat
smoking in its verandah, as the traveller rode near and made
his petition.</p>

<p>“We don’t take in travellers,” was again his answer.</p>

<p>The sick man stated his special claims to kindness, and the
planter good-naturedly inquired the particulars, asked how
far he had ridden, where he got his horse and his dog, whither
he was bound, and so on (did not ask where he was born or
what were his politics). The traveller again stated that he
was ill, unable to ride further, and begged permission to
remain for the night under the planter’s roof, and again the
planter carelessly replied that they didn’t take in travellers;
anon, asked how crops were looking further west, and talked
of guano, the war news, and the prospect for peaches. It
became dusk while the traveller lingered, and the negroes
came in with their hoes over their shoulders from the fields
across the road, but the planter continued chatting and
smoking, not even offering the traveller a cigar, till at length
the latter said, “If you really cannot keep me to-night, I
must go on, sir; I cannot keep my horse much longer, I
fear.”</p>

<p>“It is not far to the next house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span></p>

<p>“But I have already called at three houses to-night, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, since the railroad was done, people here
don’t reckon to take in travellers as they once did. So few
come along they don’t find their account in being ready for
them.”</p>

<p>The traveller asked for a drink of water, which a negro
brought in a calabash, bade good night to the planter, and
rode on through the woods. Night presently set in; the
road crossed a swamp and was difficult to follow, and for
more than an hour he rode on—seeing no house—without
stopping. Then crossing water, he deliberated whether he
should not bivouac for the night where he was. He had
with him a few biscuits and some dried figs. He had not
eaten hitherto, hoping constantly to come to a habitation
where it might happen he could get a cup of tea, of which
he felt more particularly in need. He stopped, took some
nourishment, the first he had tasted in fifteen hours, and
taking also a little brandy, gained strength and courage to
continue his journey. A bright light soon cheered him, and
after a time he made his way to a large white house, in the
rear of which was an old negro woman stirring the contents
of a caldron which stood over the fire, by which he had
been guided. The old woman had the appearance of a
house servant, and he requested her to ask her master if he
would favour him with lodging for the night.</p>

<p>“Her master did not take in travellers,” she said, “besides,
he was gone to bed;” and she stirred on, hardly looking at
the traveller till he put his hand in his pocket, and, holding
forth silver, said—</p>

<p>“Now, aunty, mind what I tell you. Do you go in to
your master, and say to him, ‘There is a gentleman outside
who says he is sick, and that his horse is tired and has had
nothing to eat to-day; that he is a stranger and has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
benighted, don’t know the roads, is not well enough to ride
further, and wants to know if you won’t be so kind as to let
him stay here to-night.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, massa, I’ll tell him; ’twon’t do no good, though, and
he’ll be almighty cross.”</p>

<p>She went in, returned after a few minutes, seized her paddle,
and began stirring before she uttered the words—</p>

<p>“Says yer ken go on to de store, he reckon.”</p>

<p>It was after ten o’clock when the traveller reached the
next house. It stood close upon the road, and the voice of a
woman answered a knock upon the door, and, in reply to the
demand, said it was not far to the store, and she reckoned
they accommodated travellers there.</p>

<p>Finally, at the store, the traveller succeeded in getting
admittance, was comfortably lodged and well entertained by
an amiable family. Their kindness was of such a character
that he felt, in the position of an invited guest, unable to
demand and unwilling to suggest any unvolunteered service.
There was no indication that the house was an inn, yet the
traveller’s experience left him little room to hesitate to offer
money, nor was there the slightest hesitation on the part of the
storekeeper in naming the amount due for the entertainment he
had, or in taking it.</p>

<p>If the reader will accept the traveller’s judgment of himself,
he will assume that there was nothing in his countenance, his
dress, his language, or his bearing, by which he could readily
be distinguished from a gentleman of Southern birth and education,
and that he was not imagined to be anything else,
certainly not on his first inquiry, at any one of the plantations
where he was thus refused shelter.</p>

<p>So far as this inhospitality (for this is, I think, what even
the Southern reader will be inclined to call it) needed explanation,
it was supposed to be sufficiently given in the fact that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
the region had, by the recent construction of a railroad
through it, approximated the condition of a well-settled and
organized community, in which the movements of travellers
are so systematized, that the business of providing for their
wants, as a matter of pecuniary profit, can no longer be made
a mere supplement of another business, but becomes a distinct
occupation.</p>

<p>This, then, but a small part of the whole land being thus
affected by railroads, was an exception in the South. True;
but what is the rule to which this is the exception?</p>

<p>Mr. De Bow says, that the traveller would have had no
apprehension that the offer of money for chance entertainment
for the night furnished him at a house on the banks of the
Connecticut, would give offence; yet in the Connecticut valley,
among people having no servants, and not a tithe of the nominal
wealth of the Red River planter, or of one of these Virginia
planters, such has been a frequent experience of the same
traveller. Nor has he ever, when calling benighted at a house,
anywhere in the State of Connecticut, far from a public-house,
escaped being invited with cordial frankness to enjoy such
accommodation as it afforded; and this, he is fully convinced,
without any thought in the majority of cases of pecuniary
remuneration. In several instances a remuneration in money
has been refused in a manner which conveyed a reproof of the
offer of it as indelicate; and it thus happens that it was a
common experience of that, of the possibility of which Mr. De
Bow is unable to conceive, that led in no small degree to the
hesitation upon which this very comment was made.</p>

<p>This simple faith in the meanness of the people of the
North, and especially of New England, is no eccentricity of
Mr. De Bow’s. It is in accordance with the general tone of
literature and of conversation at the South, that penuriousness,
disingenuousness, knavish cunning, cant, cowardice, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
hypocrisy are assumed to be the prevailing traits by which
they are distinguished from the people of the South—not the
poor people of New England from the planters of the South,
but the people generally from the people generally. Not the
tone of the political literature and of the lower class of the
South, but of its wealthy class, very generally, really of its
“better class.” Mr. De Bow is himself the associate of
gentlemen as well informed and as free from narrow prejudices
as any at the South. No New England man, who has
travelled at the South, would be surprised, indeed, if, at a
table at which he were a guest, such an assumption as that of
Mr. De Bow should be apparent in all the conversation, and
that the gist of it should be supposed to be so well understood
and generally conceded, that he could not be annoyed
thereat.</p>

<p>I need hardly say that this reference to Mr. De Bow is
continued, not for the purpose of vindicating the North any
more than myself from a mistaken criticism. I wish only to
demonstrate how necessary it must soon be to find other
means for saving the Union than these commonplace flatteries
of Southern conceit and apologies for Southern folly, to which
we have not only become so accustomed ourselves, as to hardly
believe our eyes when we are obliged to meet the facts (as
was my own case), but by which we have so successfully imposed
upon our friends, that a man like Mr. De Bow actually
supposes that the common planters of the teeming and sunny
South, are, as a rule, a more open-handed, liberal, and hospitable
class than the hard-working farmers of the bleak and
sterile hills of New England; so much so, that he feels warranted
not merely in stating facts within his personal knowledge,
illustrating the character of the latter and arguing the
causes, but in incidentally referring to their penuriousness as a
matter of proverbial contempt. Against this mistake, which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
I doubt not, is accomplishing constant mischief to our nation,
I merely oppose the facts of actual experience. I wish to do
so with true respect for the good sense of the South.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Presenting myself, and known only in the character of a
chance traveller, most likely to be in search of health, entertainment,
and information; usually taken for and treated as a
Southerner, until I stated that I was not one, I journeyed
nearly six months at one time (my second journey) through the
South. During all this journey, I came not oftener than
once a week, on an average, to public-houses, and was thus
generally forced to seek lodging and sustenance at private
houses. Often it was refused me; not unfrequently rudely
refused. But once did I meet with what Northern readers
could suppose Mr. De Bow to mean by the term (used in the
same article), “free road-side hospitality.” Not once with
the slightest appearance of what Noah Webster defines hospitality—the
“practice of receiving or entertaining strangers
without reward.”</p>

<p>Only twice, in a journey of four thousand miles, made independently
of public conveyances, did I receive a night’s
lodging or a repast from a native Southerner, without having
the exact price in money which I was expected to pay for it
stated to me by those at whose hands I received it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>If what I have just narrated had been reported to me
before I travelled in the manner I did in my second journey
at the South, I should have had serious doubts of either the
honesty or the sanity of the reporter. I know, therefore, to
what I subject myself in now giving my own name to it. I
could not but hesitate to do this, as one would be cautious in
acknowledging that he believed himself to have seen the sea-serpent,
or had discovered a new motive power. By drawing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
out the confidence of other travellers, who had chanced to
move through the South in a manner at all similar, however,
I have had the satisfaction of finding that I am not altogether
solitary in my experience. Even this day I met one fresh
from the South-west, to whom, after due approach, I gave the
article which is the text of these observations, asking to be
told how he had found it in New England and in Mississippi.
He replied.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“During four winters, I have travelled for a business purpose two
months each winter in Mississippi. I have generally spent the night at
houses with whose inmates I had some previous acquaintance. Where I
had business transactions, especially where debts were due to me, which
could not be paid, I sometimes neglected to offer payment for my night’s
lodging, but in no other case, and never in a single instance, so far as I
can now recollect, where I had offered payment, has there been any hesitation
in taking it. A planter might refrain from asking payment of a
traveller, but it is universally expected. In New England, as far as my
limited experience goes, it is not so. I have known New England farmers’
wives take a small gratuity after lodging travellers, but always with apparent
hesitation. I have known New England farmers refuse to do so. I
have had some experience in Iowa; money is there usually (not always)
taken for lodging travellers. The principal difference between the custom
at private houses there and in Alabama and Mississippi being, that in
Iowa the farmer seems to carefully reckon the exact value of the produce
you have consumed, and to charge for it at what has often seemed to me
an absurdly low rate; while in Mississippi, I have usually paid from four
to six times as much as in Iowa, for similar accommodations. I consider
the usual charges of planters to travellers extortionate, and the custom
the reverse of hospitable. I knew of a Kentucky gentleman travelling
from Eutaw to Greensboro’ [twenty miles] in his own conveyance. He
was taken sick at the crossing of the Warrior River. It was nine o’clock
at night. He averred to me that he called at every plantation on the
road, and stated that he was a Kentuckian, and sick, but was refused lodging
at each of them.”</p>
</div>

<p>This the richest county of Alabama, and the road is lined
with valuable plantations!</p>

<p>The following is an extract from a letter dated Columbus,
Mississippi, November 24, 1856, published in the London
<i>Daily News</i>. It is written by an Englishman travelling for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
commercial purposes, and tells what he has learned by experience
of the custom of the country:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is customary in travelling through this country, where towns are
few and taverns scarce and vile, to stop at the planters’ houses along the
road, and pay for your bed and board in the morning just as if you had
stayed at an inn. The custom is rather repugnant to our Old World notions
of hospitality, but it appears to me an excellent one for both the host and
his guest. The one feels less bored by demands upon his kindness, as soon
as it ceases to be merely a kindness to comply with them, and the other
has no fear about intruding or being troublesome when he knows he will
have to pay for his entertainment. It is rarely, however, that the <i>entrée</i>
can be obtained into the houses of wealthy planters in this way. They
will not be bothered by your visits, and, if you apply to them, have no hesitation
in politely passing you on to such of their neighbours as have less
money or more generosity.”</p>
</div>

<p>The same writer afterwards relates the following experience:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“About nineteen miles from Canton, I sought lodging at nightfall at a
snug house on the roadside, inhabited by an old gentleman and his two
daughters, who possessed no slaves and grew no cotton, and whose two
sons had been killed in the Mexican war, and who, with the loudest professions
of hospitality, cautiously refrained from giving himself any personal
trouble in support of them. He informed me that there was corn in
the husk in an almost inaccessible loft, there was fodder in an un-get-at-able
sort of a cage in the yard, water in a certain pond about half a mile
off, and a currycomb in a certain hole in the wall. Having furnished me
with this intelligence, he left me to draw my own conclusions as to what
my conduct ought to be under the circumstances.”</p>
</div>

<p>A naturalist, the author of a well-known standard work,
who has made several tours of observation in the Slave
States, lately confided to me that he believed that the popular
report of Southern hospitality must be a popular romance,
for never, during all his travels in the South, had he chanced
to be entertained for a single night, except by gentlemen to
whom he was formally presented by letter, or who had previously
been under obligations to him, without paying for it
in money, and to an amount quite equal to the value received.
By the wealthier, a night’s entertainment had been frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
refused him, under circumstances which, as must have been
evident to them, rendered his further progress seriously inconvenient.
Once, while in company with a foreign naturalist—a
titled man—he had been dining at the inn of a
small county-town, when a certain locally distinguished
judge had seen fit to be eloquent at the dinner-table upon the
advantages of slavery in maintaining a class of “high-toned
gentlemen,” referring especially to the proverbial hospitality of
Southern plantations, which he described as quite a bewilderment
to strangers, and nothing like which was to be found in
any country unblessed with slavery, or institutions equivalent
to it. It so happened that the following night the travellers,
on approaching a plantation mansion in quest of lodging,
were surprised to find that they had fallen upon the residence
of this same judge, who recognized them, and welcomed them
and bade them be at home. Embarrassed by a recollection
of his discourse of hospitality, it was with some difficulty that
one of them, when they were taking leave next morning,
brought himself to inquire what he might pay for the entertainment
they had received. He was at once relieved by the
judge’s prompt response, “Dollar and a quarter apiece, I
reckon.”</p>

<p>It is very true that the general custom of the South which
leads a traveller to ask for a lodging at any private house he
may chance to reach near nightfall, and to receive a favourable
answer not merely as a favour but as a matter of business,
is a convenient one, is one indeed almost necessary in a
country so destitute of villages, and where, off certain
thoroughfares of our merchants, there are so few travellers.
It is a perfectly respectable and entirely sensible custom, but
it is not, as is commonly represented to be, a custom of hospitality,
and it is not at all calculated to induce customs of
hospitality with the mass of citizens. It is calculated to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
make inhospitality of habit and inhospitality of character the
general rule; hospitality of habit and of character the exception.
Yet the common misapplication of the word to this
custom is, so far as I can ascertain, the only foundation of
the arrogant assumption of superiority of character in this
respect of the Southerners over ourselves—the only ground
of the claim that slavery breeds a race of more generous and
hospitable citizens than freedom.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The difficulty of giving anything like an intelligent and
exact estimate of the breeding of any people or of any class
of people is almost insurmountable, owing to the vagueness
of the terms which must be used, or rather to the quite
different ideas which different readers will attach to these
terms. The very word which I have employed to designate
my present subject has itself such a varied signification that
it needs to be defined at the outset. I mean to employ it in
that sense wherein, according to Webster, it covers the
ground of “nurture, instruction, and the formation of manners.”
It is something more than “manners and customs,”
then, and includes, or may include, qualities which, if not
congenital, are equally an essential part of character with
those qualities which are literally in-bred of a man. Such
qualities are mainly the result of a class of circumstances,
of the influence of which upon his character and manners
a man, or a child growing to a man, is usually unconscious,
and of which he cannot be independent if he would.</p>

<p>The general difficulty is increased in dealing with the
people of the Slave States, because among themselves all
terms defining social rank and social characteristics are
applied in a manner which can be understood only after considerable
experience; and also because the general terms of
classification, always incomplete in their significance, fail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
entirely with a large class of Southerners, whose manners
have some characteristics which would elsewhere be thought
“high bred,” if they had not other which are elsewhere
universally esteemed low and ruffianly.</p>

<p>There are undoubted advantages resulting from the effects
of slavery upon the manners of some persons. Somewhat
similar advantages I have thought that I perceived to have
resulted in the Free States, where a family has been educated
under favourable influences in a frontier community. There
is boldness, directness, largeness, confidence, with the effect
of the habitual sense of superiority to most of the community;
not superiority of wealth, and power from wealth
merely, but of a mind well stocked and refined by such advantages
of education as only very unusual wealth, or very
unusual individual energy, rightly directed, can procure
in a scattered and frontier community. When to this is
added the effect of visits to the cultivated society of denser
communities; when refined and polished manners are grafted
on a natural, easy abandon; when there is high culture without
effeminacy either of body or mind, as not unfrequently
happens, we find a peculiarly respectable and agreeable sort
of men and women. They are the result of frontier training
under the most favourable circumstances. In the class
furthest removed from this on the frontier—people who have
grown up without civilized social restraints or encouragements
and always under what in a well-conditioned community would
be esteemed great privations—happens, on the other hand,
the most disagreeable specimen of mankind that the world
breeds; men of a sort almost peculiar to America and Australia;
border ruffians, of whom the “rowdies” of our eastern
towns are tame reflections. Cooper has well described the
first class in many instances. I know of no picture of the
latter which represents them as detestable as I have found them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>

<p>The whole South is maintained in a frontier condition by
the system which is apologized for on the ground that it
favours good breeding. This system, at the same time,
tends to concentrate wealth in a few hands. If there is
wisdom and great care in the education of a family thus
favoured, the result which we see at the North, under the
circumstances I have described, is frequently reproduced.
There are many more such fruits of frontier life at the South
than the North, because there is more frontier life. There
is also vastly more of the other sort, and there is everything
between, which degrees of wealth and degrees of good fortune
in education would be expected to occasion. The bad breed
of the frontier, at the South, however, is probably far worse
than that of the North, because the frontier condition of the
South is everywhere permanent. The child born to-day on
the Northern frontier, in most cases, before it is ten years old,
will be living in a well organized and tolerably well provided
community; schools, churches, libraries, lecture and concert
halls, daily mails and printing presses, shops and machines
in variety, having arrived within at least a day’s journey of
it; being always within an influencing distance of it. There
are improvements, and communities loosely and gradually
cohering in various parts of the South, but so slowly, so
feebly, so irregularly, that men’s minds and habits are knit
firm quite independently of this class of social influences.</p>

<p>There is one other characteristic of the Southerner, which
is far more decided than the difference of climate merely
would warrant, and which is to be attributed not only
to the absence of the ordinary restraints and means of
discipline of more compact communities in his education, but
unquestionably also to the readiness and safety with which,
by reason of slavery, certain passions and impulses may be
indulged. Every white Southerner is a person of importance;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
must be treated with deference. Every wish of the Southerner
is imperative; every belief undoubted; every hate, vengeful;
every love, fiery. Hence, for instance, the scandalous
fiend-like street fights of the South. If a young man feels
offended with another, he does not incline to a ring and a fair
stand-up set-to, like a young Englishman; he will not attempt
to overcome his opponent by logic; he will not be
content to vituperate, or to cast ridicule upon him; he is
impelled straightway to strike him down with the readiest
deadly weapon at hand, with as little ceremony and pretence
of fair combat as the loose organization of the people against
violence will allow. He seems crazy for blood. Intensity of
personal pride—pride in anything a man has, or which connects
itself with him, is more commonly evident. Hence, intense
local pride and prejudice; hence intense partisanship;
hence rashness and over-confidence; hence visionary ambition;
hence assurance in debate; hence assurance in society. As
self-appreciation is equally with deference a part of what we call
good breeding, and as the expression of deference is much
more easily reduced to a matter of manners and forms, in the
commonplace intercourse of society, than self-appreciation,
this characteristic quality of the Southerner needs to be borne
in mind in considering the port and manners he commonly
has, and judging from them of the effects of slavery.</p>

<p>It must be also considered that the ordinary occupations
and amusements of people of moderate wealth at the North
are seldom resorted to at the South, that public entertainments
of any kind, for instance, are impracticable to a sparse
population; consequently that where men of wealth are
socially disposed, all intercourse with others is highly valued,
prepared for, and made the most of. Hence, with these,
the act of social intercourse is more highly esteemed, and
is much more frequently carried to a nice perfection of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
manner than it usually is with men otherwise of corresponding
education, and habits at the North.</p>

<p>In a Northern community a man who is not greatly occupied
with private business is sure to become interested in
social enterprises and to undertake duties in them which will
demand a great deal of time and strength. School, road,
cemetery, asylum, and church corporations; bridge, ferry, and
water companies; literary, scientific, art, mechanical, agricultural
and benevolent societies; all these things are
managed chiefly by the unpaid services of gentlemen during
hours which they can spare from their private interests. In
the successful operations of such enterprises they find much
of the satisfaction of their life. So, too, our young men,
who are not obliged to devote their thoughts chiefly to
business success, are members and managers of reading rooms,
public libraries, gymnasiums, game clubs, boat clubs, ball
clubs, and all sorts of clubs, Bible classes, debating societies,
military companies; they are planting road-side trees, or
damming streams for skating ponds, or rigging diving-boards,
or getting up firework displays, or private theatricals; they
are always doing something, not conversing for the entertainment
of the moment. Planters, the details of whose business
fall into the hands of overseers, and young men of fortune, at
the South, have, when at home on the plantation, none
of these occupations. Their talents all turn into two
channels, politics and sociality; the very paucity of society
making it the more esteemed and the more carefully used.
Social intercourse at the North is a relaxation from the
ordinary bent of men’s talents; at the South, it is that to
which mainly their talents are bent. Hence, with men who
are otherwise on a par, in respect of natural advantages and
education, the Southerner will have a higher standard of
manners than the Northerner, because, with him, social intercourse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
is the grand resource to which all other possible
occupations of his mind become subordinate. The Northerner,
being troubled by no monotony, unquestionably too much
neglects at present this, the highest and final art of every
type of civilization. In making this comparison, however,
it must not be forgotten that it is made between men who are
supposed to be equal in all respects, except in the possession
of this advantage, and who are equally at leisure from any
necessary habitual occupation for a livelihood.</p>

<p>Having conceded to the South certain elements of advantage
in this respect, for a single class, it still remains to
inquire where is the greatest weight of advantage for this
class, and for all classes of our citizens. In attempting to
make such a general comparison, I shall begin at the bottom
of the social ladder, and return to the class who can in a
great degree choose how they will be occupied.</p>

<p>In the North at the Revolution we scarcely had a distinct
class corresponding to the lowest white class of Virginia, as
described by Jefferson, our labourers being less ignorant and
coarse in their habits, and associating much more familiarly
with their betters. We have now a class more nearly corresponding
to it furnished by the European peasant immigration.
It is, however, a transient class, somewhat seldom
including two generations, and, on an average, I trust, not
one. It is therefore practically not an additional class, but,
overlooking the aged and diseased, a supplement to our lowest
normal class. Out of twenty Irish emigrants, landing in New
York, perfectly destitute, of whose history I have been
intimately cognizant, only two, both of whom were over fifty
years of age, have lived out five years here without beginning
to acquire wealth and becoming superior in their ambition
and habits to the lowest order, which I believe to include a
majority of the whites in the plantation districts of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
South.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Our lowest class, therefore, has a higher standard
than the lowest class of the Slave States. This, I understand,
is made very evident where the two come together
at the West, as in southern Illinois. The very poorest and
lowest New England women who go there are frequently
offended by the inconsiderate rudeness and coarseness of the
women immigrating from the South, and shocked by their
“shiftless,” comfortless, vagrant habits, so much so that
families have often removed, after having been once established,
to escape being bored and annoyed by their Southern-born
neighbours.</p>

<p>Referring to the lowest class, North and South, as the
fourth, I class as third, the lowest rank in society, North or
South, in which regard is had by its members to the quality
of their associates from other than moral motives, or the
prejudices of locality, race, sectarianism, and politics. In
other words, that in which there is a distinct social selectiveness
and pride. I think that everywhere in the Free States
men of this class would almost universally feel their position
damaged—be a little ashamed—if obliged to confess that they
did not take a newspaper, or were unable to read it with a
clear understanding of the intelligence it was intended to communicate.
Allusions to the main facts of American history,
to any clause of the Bible, to the provisions of the Constitution,
and the more important laws, State and National, would
be understood in most cases by those whom I refer to as the
third class in Northern society. In few families of this class
would you fail to find some volumes of the English poets,
or some works of great novelists or renowned travellers. Nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
like this would you find, however, in a grade of society
distinctly superior to the lowest at the South.</p>

<p>The ratio of the number of the citizens who cannot read at
all to the whole, appears, by the census returns, to be only
three times larger at the South than at the North. I believe
it to be much greater at the South than these returns indicate.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
The comparative education of the third class “North”
and of the third class “South,” however, cannot be at all
judged from these statistics, supposing them correct. Those
who can read and who do not read, or whose reading is confined
within extremely narrow limits, are a much larger
number at the South than at the North, owing to the much
poorer supply of books and newspapers which commerce can
afford to put within the reach of the former. The census
returns two million newspapers, for instance, printed annually
in Virginia, one hundred and fifteen million in New York.
There is a post-office to every fourteen square miles in New
York, one to forty-seven square miles in Virginia; over five
hundred publishers and booksellers in New York, but forty
in Virginia. Thirty thousand volumes in public libraries in
Virginia, eight hundred thousand in New York. The area
occupied by the population of Virginia being much the largest,
it may be inferred that with the disposition and the ability to
read anything in particular, the Virginian of the third class
will have to travel more than thirty times as far as the New
Yorker to procure it. The same proposition will hold good
in regard to most other means of cultivation, and the third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
class of the South generally has seemed to me to be as much
more narrow-minded, rude, coarse, “dangerous,” and miserable,
than the third class of the Free States, as the most
sanguine friend of popular education could anticipate from
these facts.</p>

<p>The great difference in character between the third class of
the South and that of the North, as indicated by their respective
manners, is found in the much less curiosity and
ready intelligent interest in matters which have not an immediate
personal bearing in that of the South. Apathetic carelessness
rather than simple indifference, or reckless incivility
as to your comfort, is what makes the low Southerner a
disagreeable companion. It is his impertinent shrewdness
which makes you wish to keep the Yankee at a distance.
The first seems without object, spiritless; the latter keen to
better himself, if with nothing else, with information which
he can draw from you, and by gaining your good opinion.</p>

<p>The next or second class would include, both North and
South, those with whose habits and character I am most
familiar, and of whom I can speak with the best right to
confidence. It would include in New England and New
York the better educated farmers—these owning, I should
say, half the agricultural land—the permanently established
manufacturers and merchants of moderate capital; most of
the shopkeepers and the better-educated master mechanics
and artisan foremen; most of the preachers, physicians,
and lawyers (some ranking higher). It would correspond
most nearly to what in England would be called the lower-middle
class, but any higher grade being very ill-defined,
existing distinctly but in few localities, and rarely recognized
as existing at all, it is in a great measure free from the
peculiar vulgarity of its English parallel.</p>

<p>The number of those at the South who correspond in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
education and refinement of manners and habits to the average
of this class of the North, it will be evident, from a similar
mode of reasoning to that before employed, must be very
much smaller relatively, either to the territory or the whole
white population of their respective regions.</p>

<p>In the comparison commonly made by Southern writers
between the condition of the people of a sparsely-settled
country and another, it is usually assumed that the advantages
of the latter are confined exclusively to towns, and to
large and crowded towns. By contrasting the evils which
concentrate in such towns with the favourable circumstances
of localities where at least wood, water, and air are abundant,
and corn enough to support life can usually be got by any
one with a little occasional labour, an argument of some
force to ignorant people is easily presented. The advantages
possessed by a people living in moderately well-occupied rural
districts, who are even more free from the evils of great
towns than their own people, are entirely overlooked by most
Southern writers. Such is the condition, however, of more
white people in the Free States than the whole white population
of the Slave States. A majority of our farmers’ daughters
can walk from their dwellings to schools of a quality such as
at the South can be maintained not twice in five hundred
square miles. These schools are practically a part of their
homes. Probably, in more than half the families of the
South, the children of which are instructed to the least degree
which would be considered “respectable,” among this second
class of the North, private governesses are obliged to be
employed, or the children must be for many years at boarding-schools.
We all know that the young women who go to the
South, to meet the demand thus occasioned for home education,
are not generally, though they may be in cases, our own
most esteemed and successful instructresses; and we also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
know from their report that their skill and labour has
necessarily to be long chiefly employed in laying those simple
foundation habits of <i>instructability</i>, which our Northern children
acquire imperceptibly from association with those of the
neighbourhood slightly in advance of them. Churches and
the various sub-organizations centreing in them, in which
class distinctions are much lost sight of, to the great advantage
of the manners of the lower classes, and little chance
of injury to the higher; libraries; literary societies; lecture
arrangements; dramatic and musical, art and scientific
entertainments, and also highly educated professional men,
with whom, for various purposes, many persons are brought
often in contact, are correspondingly more frequent at the
North, correspondingly more accessible; in other words, the
advantages to be derived from them are cheaper, and so more
influential on the manners of the people at large.</p>

<p>The common opinion has been that the Southerners or
planters of the class now under consideration, are more social,
more generous, more heartily kind and genial than Northerners.
According to my experience, the reverse of all this is true, as
a general rule. Families live so isolatedly at the South, that
any social contact, out of the family, is of course much more
eventful and stimulating than it is ordinarily at the North,
and this accounts for the common opinion. I could not but
think, however, that most persons at the South looked to the
voluntary good offices and conversation of others, both within
and without their families, for their enjoyment of the world,
much less than most at the North. It may be that when in
towns they attach a greater value to, and are more careful to
make use of the opportunities for social gathering afforded by
towns, than are Northerners. In towns they attach more
consequence to forms, are more scrupulous in matters of
etiquette, more lavish in expenditure for dress, and for certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
other things which are the signs of luxury rather than luxury
itself, such as plate and fancy brands of wines. They make
less show of fine art and less pretence of artistic judgment;
more of respect and regard for their associates, and of indifference
or superiority to all others.</p>

<p>As to manner or deportment simply, with the same impulse
and intention, that of the Southerner will habitually, under
ordinary circumstances, be best, more true, more composed,
more dignified. I have said that the second class at the
North is without the pervading vulgarity of the class to which
it most nearly corresponds in England, the reason being that
those which constitute it seldom wish or attempt to appear to
belong to a superior class, not clearly recognizing a superior
class. Individuals, however, very generally have a strong
desire to be thought better informed, more ingenious, more
witty, as well as more successful in their enterprises than
they are, and this stamps them with a peculiar quality of
manners vulgarly called “smartness,” the absence of which
makes Southern men and women generally much more agreeable
companions than Northerners of the same degree of
education and accomplishments in other respects. Not but
that snobs abound; of these it will be more convenient to
speak under the next division, however.</p>

<p>The traditional “old family,” stately but condescending,
haughty but jovial, keeping open house for all comers on the
plantations of Virginia or South Carolina, is not wholly a myth.</p>

<p>There really was something which, with some sort of propriety,
could be termed a gentry in Carolina and Virginia in
their colony days; yet of the names which are now thought
to have belonged to it, as descended of brave, loyal, and
adventurous cavaliers, some I once saw in London upon an
old freight-list of a ship outward bound for Virginia, with the
addition of tinker and tailor, poacher and pickpocket, all to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
be sold for life, or a term of years, to the highest bidder when
they should arrive. A large majority of the fathers of Virginia
were unquestionably of this class.</p>

<p>What was properly to be termed the gentry in Virginia and
South Carolina previous to the Revolution, was very small in
number. A large proportion of the families who composed it,
and who remained after the Revolution in the country (for many
were Tories) have since passed in all their branches through a
poverty-stricken period, very dissipating in its influence upon
hereditary breeding, novelists and dramatic old servants to
the contrary notwithstanding. Many of those who have retained
wealth and family pride in succession to the present
time, have undeniably, from various causes, degenerated
wofully in breeding. Coarse tastes and brutal dispositions
cannot be disguised under a cavalier address, and the most
assured readiness in the established forms of polite society.
Of the real “old families” which remain at all “well bred”
in their qualities, habits, and manners, by reason of their
lineage, I think it will be difficult for most readers who have
not studied the matter at all to form a sufficiently small estimate;
call them a dozen or a hundred, what does it matter
in a region much larger than the old German empire? Associating
with these are a few hundred more new or recuperated
families, in which there is also the best breeding, and in certain
few parts or districts of the South, to be defined and
numbered without difficulty, there is a wealthy, distinct,
generous, hospitable, refined, and accomplished first class,
clinging with some pertinacity, although with too evident an
effort, to the traditional manners and customs of an established
gentry.</p>

<p>There was a gentry in the North as well as in Virginia
and Carolina in the colony period, though a less important
and numerous one. As the North has been much more prosperous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
as the value of its property has much more rapidly
increased than that of the South, the advantages of wealth
have, I believe, been more generally retained in families, and
probably the number of those who could trace their breeding
in an uninterrupted parental influence from the colonial
gentry, is now larger at the North than the South.</p>

<p>Including new families, in whose habits and manners and
conversation the best bred people of Europe would find nothing
more offensive and inharmonious with themselves than
might be ascribed to local fashion or a desire to avoid appearances
which, though perfectly proper in an aristocratic society,
would be snobbish in a republic, there is unquestionably at this
time a very much larger number of thoroughly well-bred
people in the Free than in the Slave States. It is equally
certain that the proportion of such people to the whole population
of whites is larger at the North than the South.</p>

<p>The great majority of wealthy planters who at the present
day assume for themselves a special social respectability and
superiority to the class I have defined as the second, are, as
a general rule, not only distinguished for all those qualities
which our satirists and dramatists are accustomed to assume
to be the especial property of the newly rich of the Fifth
Avenue, but, as far as I have had opportunity to observe
both classes, are far more generally and ridiculously so than
the would-be fashionable people of New York, or of any other
part of the United States. It is a part of the <i>rôle</i> they
undertake to act, to be hospitable and generous, as it was
lately that of our fops to be sleepy and critical. They are
not hospitable and generous, however; they know not the
meaning of these terms. They are absurdly ostentatious in
entertainment, and extravagant in the purchase of notoriety;
possibly they have more tact in this than our Potiphars, but
such has not been my personal observation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Before the advent of modern science, any idea of systematic laws of
human improvement would have been deemed alike impossible and absurd;
but the constant observation of facts, the exact statistics recorded, the progress
of science in all departments, has made it possible to conceive of, and
probable that there actually exist <i>uniform laws of social movement</i>, based
upon any given condition of society. If the <i>elementary social</i> condition be
different in regard to religion, government, arts, science, industry, the
resulting movements of society will be different. Hence, when we have
ascertained by accurate observation upon and record of the social phenomena,
that the social movement is uniformly in a certain direction, and
that certain results uniformly follow, we shall know in what <i>elements</i> the
conditions of society must be changed, in order to change the results.
Hence, when this law of social movements is ascertained, the philanthropist,
legislator, and jurist will know precisely what must be done, and how,
in order to remove the evils, or reform the wrongs, or produce the results
they desire. They will know that <i>certain elementary conditions of society</i>
must be changed, and they well know that by removing temptations, or
laying restraints, or enlightening the mind, or changing the course of industry,
or producing new arts, they will change the social tendency, and
thus change the results. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp; Society, or that part of it which thinks and
acts, can change the results by changing the elementary conditions which
produce them. When you know exactly what the change ought to be, it
is not very difficult to produce it; nor does it follow that because a thousand
crimes must be committed in Ohio, that a thousand particular individuals
<i>must</i> commit them. It is true that the individual frequently acts
from motives, but is it not just as true that the individual frequently
seeks these motives, and presents them to himself?”—<i>From the Report of
the Ohio State Commissioner of Statistics</i>, 1859.</p>

<p>The field-hand negro is, on an average, a very poor and
very bad creature, much worse than I had supposed before I
had seen him and grown familiar with his stupidity, indolence,
duplicity, and sensuality. He seems to be but an imperfect
man, incapable of taking care of himself in a civilized manner,
and his presence in large numbers must be considered a
dangerous circumstance to a civilized people.</p>

<p>A civilized people, within which a large number of such
creatures has been placed by any means not within its own
control, has claims upon the charity, the aid, if necessary, of
all other civilized peoples in its endeavours to relieve itself
from the danger which must be apprehended from their
brutal propensities, from the incompleteness of their human
sympathies—their inhumanity—from their natural love of
ease, and the barbaric want of forethought and providence,
which would often induce desperate want among them. Evidently
the people thus burthened would have need to provide
systematically for the physical wants of these poor creatures,
else the latter would be liable to prey with great waste upon
their substance. Perhaps the very best thing to do would be
to collect them into small herds, and attach each herd to a
civilized family, the head of which should be responsible for
its safe keeping. Such a superintendent should of course
contrive, if possible, to make his herd contribute in some way
to the procuring of its necessary sustenance; and if, besides
this, he even turned their feeble abilities to such good account
by his superior judgment, that they actually procured
a considerable surplus of food and clothing for the benefit of
others, should not Christendom applaud and encourage his exertions,
even if a certain amount of severity and physical constraint
had been found necessary to accomplish this success?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Let us endeavour to assume a similar difficulty for ourselves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
Let us suppose that a large part—the proportion
varying with the locality—of our own community should
next year suffer from some new malady, the result of which
should in no case be fatal, but which should, like the <i>goître</i> of
Savoy, leave all who were affected by it permanently injured
in their intellects, with diminished bodily activity, and fiercer
animal propensities. (I take this method of stating the case,
because some of us who only see the negro as he exists at the
North might find it difficult to imagine him as he is known
to the planters.)</p>

<p>Suppose, further, that this malady should be confined to
certain families, as if its seed had been received hundreds of
years ago by numerous individuals, and only their descendants
(but all of these to the most distant trace of the blood)
now suffered from it. Also, that some of our doctors should
be of the opinion that the effects of the malady upon the
intellect would descend to the children, and to all descendants
of those who suffered. Suppose that these unfortunates
should be subject to certain hallucinations, that they should
be liable to think themselves sane and able to take care of
themselves, and that when possessed with these ideas that
they should be quite cunning and dangerous in attempting to
exercise the usual prerogatives of sane men.</p>

<p>What should we do with them?</p>

<p>Finding them in a degree tractable; and sensible enough,
after all, to yield readily, if not cheerfully, to superior force,
we might herd them together on a sort of farm-hospitals, and
let them earn their living, giving especially capable men
charge of many, and rewarding them with good salaries, and
ordinary small farmers, smaller numbers, with smaller compensations
for overseeing them?</p>

<p>Of course, we should place every possible legislative guard
and check upon these superintendents and overseers to secure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
fair and honest dealing, to prevent them from making perquisites
for themselves at the expense of a reasonable comfort
in their institutions. Careful instructions to secure economical
sustenance, and how to turn such labour as could be got from
the unfortunates to the best account, in defraying the cost of
their keeping, would also be framed by talented men and
furnished each keeper.</p>

<p>And having regard to national wealth, to the temporal
good of the commonwealth, this is about all that common
sense would lead us to do, at least through the agency of
government.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Is this all, reader?</p>

<p>You have too much overlooked our small matters of State,
if you think so. We have a few crazy people, a few fools,
not enough to be a matter of much consideration to our
statesmen or legislators, yet we have a State system in our
dealing with them, such as it is, and such as it is it puts our
dealing with them on a little different footing than would
the system I have above imagined. What I have imagined
is not quite all we have for some time been in the habit of
doing when we did anything with this class. And judging
from what we have done, it does not seem as if it would be
all that we should do in such an emergency as I have supposed,
engaging as it would all the talent of the country to
diminish as much as possible the necessary results of the
calamity.</p>

<p>We should, it appears, call upon our learned doctors
eagerly to study; we should each of us eagerly observe for ourselves
whether the fearful infirmity by which so many were
incapacitated for their former usefulness, were not only absolutely
incurable, but also absolutely not possible to be alleviated.
And if our observation should satisfy us, if our doctors could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
not deny that, with judicious treatment, a considerable alleviation
could be effected, so much so indeed, that with a
very large part a close approximation to the normal condition
of sane and capable mankind could be obtained, there are
doubtless those amongst us who would think this a dangerous
and an infidel presumption. Just as every year some
miserable wretch is found in our dark places to have a crazy
father or brother whom he keeps in a cage in his garret,
and whose estate he takes care of, and who is of the opinion
that it will be of no use, but, on the contrary, a manifest
defiance of Divine Providence, and most dangerous to life
and property to let this unfortunate out of his cage, to surround
him with comforts, and contrive for him cheerful occupation,
as our State requires shall be done. But would the
average common sense and humanity of the people of the
Free States allow them to refuse all reduction from their usual
annual incomes; refuse to suffer all necessary addition to
then usual taxes; refuse to burden their minds with the
difficulties of the all-absorbing problem, in order to initiate
a remedial system? Our worst and most cowardly legislature
would never dare adjourn leaving this duty incompletely
performed. There are thousands on thousands of our citizens
who would not only spare from their incomes, but would
divide their estates for such a purpose. There is not a
county that would not submit to the highest war taxes for it.</p>

<p>Suppose that the doctors and that the universal observation
of the community should determine that the defective
class were not only capable of being improved, but that so
far as their limited intellects permitted, the laws of improvement
were the same for them as for healthy men; that they
were found to be influenced by a liking for food and drink,
for the society of each other and of sane men, for the admiration
and respect of each other and of sane men, for their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
ease, for dancing, for music and other amusements; and that
their imperfect natures could be acted upon, drawn out, and
enlarged by means of these likings. Suppose that it were
found that nearly all of them had still some knowledge of
religion, that although they were inclined sometimes to
consider sane men as their enemies, they were yet, in most
cases, by judicious play upon their inclinations and disinclinations,
capable of being trained quite beyond the most
sagacious of our domestic animals, even to read intelligently.
Should we, because there were so many of them, go back
two hundred years in our civilization, denying ourselves the
addition which this capacity would give to their powers of
usefulness, and consequently of economy of maintenance;
denying them the advantages for improvement which we
now in every State give to our hopelessly insane, to our
blind and mute, to our fools, to our worst and most dangerous
criminals.</p>

<p>Why do we not pass laws forbidding criminals and maniacs
to read? Our fathers did not allow them to read when
negroes were introduced in Virginia. But every man among
us whom we call well informed, now knows that it is a
profitable business for the State, which has so little profitable
business, even to provide teachers and books for a portion
of her criminals, to allow books and encourage reading with
all. To provide books, to provide physicians, to provide
teachers, to provide halls and gardens of recreations, as stimulants
to healthful thought for our madmen and our fools; to
this the State is impelled equally by considerations of safety
and of economy. Even Kentucky has its State institution
for the development of manhood in fools born of white
women.</p>

<p>Does not every such man know, too, that, given an improvable
mind with a sound body, possessed of the natural instincts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
the usual desires, appetites, aversions, no matter if at starting
the being is even what we call an idiot, a drivelling imbecile,
disgusting all who see him, a sheer burden upon society, the
process of making him clean in his habits, capable of labouring
with a good and intelligent purpose, and of associating
inoffensively with others, is just as certain in its principles and
in its progress—infinite progress—as the navigation of a ship
or the building of a house?</p>

<p>This is even so with a cretin, whose body is deformed beyond
remedy, whose brain is contracted, whose face is contorted,
whose limbs are half paralyzed, whose every organ is defective,
and who has inherited these conditions from goitrous parents
and grandparents.</p>

<p>Dr. Seguin says: “The idiot wishes for nothing; he
wishes only to remain in his vacuity.”</p>

<p>Even so thinks Dr. Cartwright of the negro; and surely
nothing worse can be thought of him.</p>

<p>But Dr. Seguin adds: “To treat successfully this ill-will
[indisposition to take care of himself], the physician wills that
the idiot should act <i>and think himself, of himself and,
finally, by himself</i>. The incessant volition of the moral
physican urges incessantly the idiot into the sphere of activity
of thinking, of labour, of duty, and affectionate feelings.”</p>

<p>Is there no such law of progression of capacity for the black
imbeciles? All the laws of the South have the contrary aims:
to withdraw them as much as possible from the sphere of self-willed
activity, thought, labour—to prevent the negro from
thinking by himself, of himself, for himself; and the principle
on which these laws are based is thus defined by Mr. De
Bow:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Almighty has thought well to place certain of His creatures in
certain <i>fixed positions</i> in this world of ours, for what cause He has not
seen fit to make quite clear to our limited capacities; and why an ass is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
not a man, and a man is not an ass, will probably for ever remain a mystery.”
“God made the world; God gave thee thy place, my hirsute
brother, and, according to all earthly possibilities and probabilities, it is
thy destiny there to remain, bray as thou wilt. From the same great
power have our sable friends, Messrs. Sambo, Cuffee, &amp; Co., received their
position also.... Alas, my poor black brother! thou, like thy hirsute
friend, must do thy braying in vain.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Are there laws on our statute-books to prevent asses from
being taught to read?</p>

<p>The <i>Richmond Examiner</i> says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“These immigrants do not, like our ancestors, fly from religious and
political persecution; they come merely as animals in search of a richer
and fresher pasture. They come to gratify physical want—for moral,
intellectual, or religious wants they have not acquired. They will settle
in large masses, and, for ages to come, will practise and inculcate a
pure (or rather impure) materialism. Mormonism is a fit exponent, proof,
and illustration of our theory. The mass of them are sensual, grovelling,
low-minded agrarians, and nine-tenths of them would join the Mormons,
or some such brutal, levelling sect, if an opportunity offered to do so.</p>

<p>“European writers describe a large class of population throughout
England and the Continent as being distinguished by restless, wandering,
nomadic habits, and by a peculiar conformation of the skull and face.
Animal and sensual nature largely predominates, with them, over the
moral and intellectual. It is they who commit crimes, fill prisons, and
adorn the gallows. They will not submit to the restraints of law or
religion, nor can they be educated. From their restless and lawless
habits, we should infer they composed a large part of the northern immigration.”</p>
</div>

<p>If all this were true, and were felt by us to be true, should
we think it necessary to put the minds of these beings in fetters?
Should we hold it to be dangerous if one should undertake
to strengthen their intellects, to give them larger ideas?</p>

<p>If all the slaves in the United States were “real Congo
niggers,” which not one in a thousand is, and if all real
Congo niggers were as incapable, and as beastly, and as
savage in their propensities as the very worst of them are asserted
to be, would the method of dealing with them which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
the legislation of the Slave States, and which a large part of
the labour of the Congress and Executive of our nation is
directed to the purpose of perpetuating, be felt to be strictly
in accordance with sound and well-established economico-political
principles? The purpose of that legislation is avowed
to be merely to secure safety with economy. Would a project
for establishing an institution planned upon the principles of
the ancient Bedlam and the ancient Bridewell be felt to-day
to be completely justified among us, by the statement that
highwaymen and maniacs will endanger life and the security
of our property if they are not somehow taken care of?</p>

<p>If there had been no Mettray with its Demetz, no Norfolk
Island with its Machonochie, no Hanwell with its Connolly,
no Abendberg with its Guggenbuhl; if the courage, devotion,
and labour of Pinel, Sicard, and Seguin had been in vain; if
there had been no progress in the science of civilized society
since the days of Howard, we might listen with merely silent
sadness to such, an excuse for debilitating the weak, for holding
down the fallen; for permitting brutal keepers to exasperate
the mad, and mercenary nurses to stupefy the idiotic; we
might, if we saw it to be necessary to preserve a civilized community
from destruction, even give its object our aid; but with
the knowledge which in our time is everywhere else acted upon,
it is impossible for us not to feel that such an argument is a
specious and a fallacious one, and that no State can long act
upon it with safety, much less with economy.</p>

<p>And surely the system by which intellectual demands and
ambition are repressed in the negro is as little calculated to
produce the security which is its object, as it is to turn his
physical abilities to the most profitable use for his owner.
How far it fails in this respect, the extra-legal measures of
safety and the semi-instinctive habits of unconscious precaution
which pervade Southern society evince. I say unconscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
precaution, because Southerners themselves seem to have generally
a very inadequate idea of the influence of slavery upon
their habits in this way, and this is very natural.</p>

<p>“Every habit breeds unconsciousness of its existence in the
mind of the man whom it controls, and this is more true of
habits which involve our safety than of any others. The
weary sailor aloft, on the look-out, may fall asleep; but, in
the lurch of the ship, his hands will clench the swaying cordage
only the more firmly, that they act in the method of
instinct. A hard-hunted fugitive may nod in his saddle, but
his knees will not unloose their hold upon his horse. Men
who live in powder-mills are said to lose all conscious feeling
of habitual insecurity; but visitors perceive that they have
acquired a constant softness of manner and of voice.</p>

<p>“If a labourer on a plantation should insolently contradict
his master, it may often appear to be no more than a reasonable
precaution for his master to kill him on the spot; for,
when a slave has acquired such boldness, it may be evident
that not merely is his value as property seriously diminished,
but that the attempt to make further use of him at all, as
property, involves in danger the whole white community. ‘If
I let this man live, and permit him the necessary degree of
freedom to be further useful to me, he will infect with his
audacity all my negro property, which will be correspondingly
more difficult to control, and correspondingly reduced
in value. If he treats me with so little respect now, what
have I to anticipate when he has found other equally independent
spirits among the slaves? They will not alone make
themselves free, but will avenge upon me, and my wife, and
my daughters, and upon all our community, the injustice which
they will think has been done them, and their women, and
children.’ Thus would he reason, and shudder to think what
might follow if he yielded to an impulse of mercy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span></p>

<p>“To suppose, however, that the master will pause while he
thus weighs the danger exactly, and then deliberately act as,
upon reflection, he considers the necessities of the case demand,
is absurd. The mere circumstance of his doing so
would nourish a hopeful spirit in the slave, and stimulate
him to consider how he could best avoid all punishment.
Hence the instinct-like habit of precaution with individuals,
and hence the frenzy which often seizes whole communities.</p>

<p>“But ‘planters sleep unguarded, and with their bedroom
doors open.’ So, as it was boasted, did the Emperor at
Biarritz, and with greater bravery, because the assassin of
Napoleon would be more sure, in despatching him, that there
would be no one left with a vital interest to secure punishment
for such a deed: and because, if he failed, Napoleon
dare never employ such exemplary punishment for his
enemies as would the planters for theirs. The emperors of
the South are the whole free society of the South, and it is a
society of mutual assurance. Against a slave who has the
disposition to become an assassin, his emperor has a bodyguard,
which, for general effectiveness, is to the Cent Garde
as your right hand is to your right hand’s glove.</p>

<p>“It is but a few months since, in Georgia or Alabama, a
man treated another precisely as Mr. Brooks treated Mr.
Sumner—coming up behind him, with the fury of a madman,
and felling him with a bludgeon; killing him by the first
blow, however, and then discharging vengeance by repeated
strokes upon his senseless body.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The man thus pitifully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
abused had been the master of the other, a remarkably confiding
and merciful master, it was said—too much so. ‘It
never does to be too slack with niggers.’ By such indiscretion
he brought his death upon him. But did his assassin
escape? He was roasted, at a slow fire, on the spot of the
murder, in the presence of many thousand slaves, driven to
the ground from all the adjoining counties, and when, at
length, his life went out, the fire was intensified until his
body was in ashes, which were scattered to the winds and
trampled under foot. Then ‘magistrates and clergymen’
addressed appropriate warnings to the assembled subjects.
It was not thought indiscreet to leave doors open again that
night.</p>

<p>“Will any traveller say that he has seen no signs of discontent,
or insecurity, or apprehension, or precaution; that
the South has appeared quieter and less excited, even on the
subject of slavery, than the North; that the negroes seem
happy and contented, and the citizens more tranquilly engaged
in the pursuit of their business and pleasure? Has
that traveller been in Naples? Precisely the same remarks
apply to the appearance of things there at this moment [the
moment of this writing—it was in 1857].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span></p>

<p>“The massacre of Hayti opened in a ball-room. Mr. Cobden
judged there was not the smallest reason in the French king’s
surrounding himself with soldiers the day before the hidden
force of insubordination broke forth and cast him forth from
his kingdom. It is true, however, that the tranquillity of the
South is the tranquillity of Hungary and of Poland, rather
than of France or the Two Sicilies; the tranquillity of hopelessness
on the part of the subject race. But, in the most
favoured regions, this broken spirit of despair is as carefully
preserved by the citizens, and with as confident and unhesitating
an application of force, when necessary to teach
humility, as it is by the army of the Czar, or the omnipresent
police of the Kaiser. In Richmond, and Charleston, and New
Orleans, the citizens are as careless and gay as in Boston or
London, and their servants a thousand times as childlike and
cordial, to all appearance, in their relations with them as our
servants are with us. But go to the bottom of this security
and dependence, and you come to police machinery such as
you never find in towns under free government: citadels,
sentries, passports, grape-shotted cannon, and daily public
whippings for accidental infractions of police ceremonies. I
happened myself to see more direct expression of tyranny in a
single day and night at Charleston, than at Naples [under
Bomba] in a week; and I found that more than half the inhabitants
of this town were subject to arrest, imprisonment,
and barbarous punishment, if found in the streets without a
passport after the evening ‘gun-fire.’ Similar precautions
and similar customs may be discovered in every large town in
the South.</p>

<p>“Nor is it so much better, as is generally imagined, in the
rural districts. Ordinarily there is no show of government
any more than at the North: the slaves go about with as
much apparent freedom as convicts in a dockyard. There is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
however, nearly everywhere, always prepared to act, if not
always in service, an armed force, with a military organization,
which is invested with more arbitrary and cruel power
than any police in Europe. Yet the security of the whites is
in a much less degree contingent on the action of the ‘patrols’
than upon the constant, habitual, and instinctive surveillance
and authority of all white people over all black. I have seen
a gentleman, with no commission or special authority, oblige
negroes to show their passports, simply because he did not
recognize them as belonging to any of his neighbours. I
have seen a girl, twelve years old, in a district where, in ten
miles, the slave population was fifty to one of the free, stop
an old man on the public road, demand to know where he
was going, and by what authority, order him to face about
and return to his plantation, and enforce her command with
turbulent anger, when he hesitated, by threatening that she
would have him well whipped if he did not instantly obey.
The man quailed like a spaniel, and she instantly resumed the
manner of a lovely child with me, no more apprehending that
she had acted unbecomingly, than that her character had been
influenced by the slave’s submission to her caprice of supremacy;
no more conscious that she had increased the security
of her life by strengthening the habit of the slave to the
master race, than is the sleeping seaman that he tightens his
clutch of the rigging as the ship meets each new billow.</p>

<p>“There is no part of the South in which the people are
more free from the direct action of slavery upon the character,
or where they have less to apprehend from rebellion, than
Eastern Tennessee. Yet, after the burning of a negro near
Knoxville, a few years ago, the deed was justified, as necessary
for the maintenance of order among the slaves, by the
editor of a newspaper (the <i>Register</i>), in the following terms:—‘It
was,’ he observed, ‘a means of absolute, necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
self-defence, which could not be secured by an ordinary resort
to the laws. Two executions on the gallows have occurred
in this county within a year or two past, and the example
has been unavailing. Four executions by hanging have taken
place, heretofore, in Jefferson, of slaves guilty of similar
offences, and it has produced no radical terror or example for
the others designing the same crimes, and hence any example
less horrible and terrifying would have availed nothing here.’</p>

<p>“The other local paper (the <i>Whig</i>), upon the same occasion,
used the following language:—</p>

<p>“‘We have to say in defence of the act, that it was not perpetrated
by an excited multitude, but by one thousand citizens—good
citizens at that—who were cool, calm, and deliberate.’</p>

<p>“And the editor, who is a Methodist preacher, presently
adds, after explaining the enormity of the offence with which
the victim was charged—‘We unhesitatingly affirm that the
punishment was unequal to the crime. Had we been there
we should have taken a part, and even suggested the pinching
of pieces out of him with red-hot pincers—the cutting off
of a limb at a time, and then burning them all in a heap.
The possibility of his escaping from jail forbids the idea of
awaiting the tardy movements of the law.’ [Although one
thousand trusty citizens volunteered to guard him at the
stake.]</p>

<p>“How much more horrible than the deed are these apologies
for it. They make it manifest that it was not accidental
in its character, but a phenomenon of general and fundamental
significance. They explain the paralytic effect upon
the popular conscience of the great calamity of the South.
They indicate a necessary tendency of people living under
such circumstances to return in their habits of thought to the
dark ages of mankind. For who, from the outside, can fail to
see that the real reason why men in the middle of the nineteenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
century, and in the centre of the United States, are
publicly burned at the stake, is one much less heathenish,
less disgraceful to the citizens than that given by the
more zealous and extemporaneous of their journalistic exponents—the
desire to torture the sinner proportionately to
the measure of his sin. Doubtless, this reverend gentleman
expresses the utmost feeling of the ruling mind of his community.
But would a similar provocation have developed a
similar avenging spirit in any other nominally Christian or
civilized people? Certainly not. All over Europe, and in
every Free State—California, for significant reasons, temporarily
excepted—in similar cases, justice deliberately takes its
course; the accused is systematically assisted in defending or
excusing himself. If the law demands his life, the infliction
of unnecessary suffering, and the education of the people in
violence and feelings of revenge, is studiously avoided. Go
back to the foundation of the custom which thus neutralizes
Christianity among the people of the South, which carries
them backward blindly against the tide of civilization, and
what do we find it to be? The editor who still retains
moral health enough to be suspected—as men more enlightened
than their neighbours usually are—of heterodoxy,
answers. To follow the usual customs of civilization elsewhere
would not be felt safe. To indulge in feelings of
humanity would not be felt safe. To be faithful to the precepts
of Christ would not be felt safe. To act in a spirit of
cruel, inconsiderate, illegal, violent, and pitiless vengeance,
must be permitted, must be countenanced, must be defended by
the most conservative, as a ‘means of absolute, necessary self-defence.’
To educate the people practically otherwise would
be felt to be suicidal. Hence no free press, no free pulpit,
no free politics can be permitted in the South. Hence every
white stripling in the South may carry a dirk-knife in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
his pocket, and play with a revolver before he has learned
to swim.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>I happened to pass through Tennessee shortly after this
tragedy, and conversed with a man who was engaged in it—a
mild, common-sense native of the country. He told me that
there was no evidence against the negro but his own confession.
I suggested that he might have been crazy. “What
if he was?” he asked with a sudden asperity. What if he
was, to be sure? The slaves who were brought together to
witness his torture were not insane. They were at least
capable of instruction. That day they were given a lesson;
were taught to know their masters better; were taught
that when ordinary and legal discipline failed, resort would
be had to more potent means of governing them. A better
informed man, having regard to the ignorance of a stranger,
might have answered me: “It was of no consequence, practically,
whether he were sane or mad. We do not wish our
slaves to study the right and the wrong of every exciting
occurrence. To say that being mad the negro was not
responsible, therefore not guilty of a crime, therefore not to
be punished, would be proclaiming to them that only that
which is wrong is to be dreaded. Whatever offends us, whatever
is against our will and pleasure, is what a slave must be
made to dread.”</p>

<p>Constantly, and everywhere throughout the South, are there
occurrences of this significance; I do not say as horrible,
though I can answer for it, that no year in the last ten has
passed without something as bad;<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> but constantly and
everywhere of the same nature, of the same impulse, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
same reasoning, the same purposes, the same disregard of
principles of society, which no people can ever set aside and
not have reason to feel their situation insecure. It is false,
it is the most dangerous mistake possible to assume that this
feeling of insecurity, this annihilation of the only possible
basis of security in human society, is, in the slightest degree,
the result of modern agitation. It is the fundamental law of
slavery, as distinctly appears in the decision of Justice Ruffin,
of North Carolina, in the case of the State <i>v.</i> Mann.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The
American system of slavery from its earliest years (as shown
p. 496, “Seaboard Slave States”), and without cessation to
the present time, has had this accompaniment. Less in the
last twenty years, if anything, than before. Would it not be
more just to say that this element of the present system was
the cause of agitation? Must not the determined policy of
the South to deal with slavery on the assumption that it is,
in its present form, necessary, just, good, and to be extended,
strengthened, and perpetuated indefinitely, involve constant
agitation as a necessary incident of the means used to carry it
out? I do not say with you or with me, reader, but with a
goodly number of any civilized community? Do you not, who
wish to think otherwise, consider that it will always require
what you must deem a superior mind not to be overcome by
incidents necessary to the carrying out of this determination?
And will not such agitation give renewed sense of danger,
and occasion renewed demands for assurance from us?</p>

<p>I have remarked before that in no single instance did I
find an inquiry of the owner or the overseer of a large plantation
about the poor whites of its vicinity fail to elicit an
expression indicating habitual irritation with them. This
equally with the polished and tranquil gentleman of South
Carolina and the rude pioneer settler of Texas, himself born a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
dirt-eating sand-hiller. It was evident in most cases, and in
one it was distinctly explained to me by a Louisianian planter,
that the reason of this was not merely the bad effect upon
the discipline of the plantation, which was had by the intercourse
between these people and the slaves, but that it was
felt that the contrast between the habits of the former—most
of the time idle, and when working, working only for their
own benefit and without a master—constantly offered suggestions
and temptations to the slaves to neglect their duty, to
run away and live a vagabond life, as these poor whites were
seen to. Hence, one of the acknowledged advantages of very
large and isolated plantations, and hence, in part, the desire
of every planter to get possession of the land of any poor
non-slaveholding neighbour.</p>

<p>As few Southern writers seem to have noticed this, I
suppose that few Southerners are aware how universal with
planters is this feeling. My attention being early directed to
the causes of the condition of the poor whites, I never failed
to make inquiries of planters, and of intelligent men especially,
about those in their neighbourhood; and being soon
struck by the constant recurrence of similar expressions with
regard to them, I was the more careful to introduce the
subject at every proper opportunity, and, I repeat, always
with the same result. I am afraid that the feeling of the
South to the North is (more or less defined in individual
minds) of the same nature, and that the contiguity of a
people whose labourers take care of themselves, and labour
industriously without being owned, can never be felt to be
safe by slaveholders. That it must always be looked upon
with apprehension, with a sense of danger, more or less vague,
more or less well defined, but always sufficient to lead to
efforts intended to counteract its natural influence—its influence
not so much with slaves, certainly not alone with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
slaves, but also with that important element of population
which reaps no profit from the good behaviour of the slaves.</p>

<p>In De Bow’s “Review” for January, 1850, will be found the
following passage in an article discussing the practicability of
employing the non-slaveholding whites in factories, the argument
being that there will be less danger of their becoming
“Abolitionists” under such circumstances than at present
exists:-</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The great mass of our poor white population begin to understand
that they have rights, and that they, too, are entitled to some of the
sympathy which falls upon the suffering. They are fast learning that
there is an almost infinite world of industry opening before them by
which they can elevate themselves and their families from wretchedness
and ignorance to competence and intelligence. It is this great upheaving
of our masses that we have to fear, so far as our institutions are
concerned.”</p>
</div>

<p>It is, in the nature of things, while slaveholders refuse the
slightest concession to the spirit of the age—while, in their
legislation, they refuse to recognize, in the slightest degree,
the principles of social science under which we live, and must
live, and which every civilized people has fully adopted, that
they should endeavour to make it appear the fault of others
that they do not feel assured of safety and at ease with themselves;
that they should try to make their own ignorant
people believe that it is from without all danger is to be
apprehended—all assurance of safety to be clamoured for—that
they should endeavour to make themselves believe it.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span></p>
<p>Those who seriously propose to stop all agitation on the
subject of slavery, by causing the Abolitionists to refrain from
proceedings which cause apprehension at the South, by
silencing all who entertain sentiments the utterance of which
is deemed a source of “danger to Southern institutions,” by
refraining themselves from all proceedings which will be
looked upon with alarm by their fellow-citizens of the Slave
States, can know very little of what would be required before
the South were satisfied. The destruction of some million
dollars’ cost in school and text books would be one of the first
things, and yet but a small item in the undertaking. Books
which directly comment upon slavery are considered comparatively
safe, because their purpose being defined, they can be
guarded against. As is well understood, it is the insidious
attacks of a free press that are most feared. But is it well
understood what are felt to be “insidious attacks?” Some idea
may be formed from the following passages which I take, not
from the heated columns of a daily newspaper, but from the
cool pages of the deliberate De Bow’s “Review.” The apprehension
they express is not of to-day; in the first article
from which I quote (which was published in the middle of Mr.
Pierce’s presidential term), reference is made to warnings of
the same character which have been sounded from time to time
before; and this very number of the “Review” contains a testimonial
from fifty-five Southern senators and representatives
in Congress to the “ability and accuracy” of its “exposition
of the working of the system of polity of the Southern States.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our text books are abolition books. They are so to the extent of their
capacity.”... “We have been too careless and indifferent to the
import of these things.”</p>

<p>“And so long as we use such works as ‘Wayland’s Moral Science,’ and
the abolition geographies, readers, and histories, overrunning, as they do,
with all sorts of slanders, caricatures, and blood-thirsty sentiments, let us
never complain of their [northern Church people’s] use of that transitory
romance [Uncle Tom’s Cabin]. They seek to array our children by false<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
ideas, against the established ordinance of God; and it sometimes takes
effect. A professor in one of our Southern seminaries, not long since
placed in the hands of a pupil ‘Wayland’s Moral Science,’ and informed
her that the chapter on slavery was heretical and unscriptural, and that
she would not be examined on that chapter, and need not study it.
<i>Perhaps</i> she didn’t. But on the day of examination she wished her
teacher to tell her ‘if that chapter was heretical how she was to know
but they were all so?’ We might enumerate many other books of similar
character and tendencies. But we will refer to only one more—it is
‘Gilbert’s Atlas’—though the real author’s name does not appear on the
title page. On the title page it is called ‘Appleton’s Complete Guide of
the World;’ published by D. Appleton &amp; Co, New York. This is an
elegant and comprehensive volume, endorsed by the Appletons and sent
South, containing hidden lessons of the most fiendish and murderous
character that enraged fanaticism could conceive or indite.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> It is a sort
of literary and scientific infernal machine. And whatever the design may
have been, the tendency is as shocking as the imagination can picture....
This is the artillery and these the implements England and our
own recreant sister States are employing to overturn the order of society
and the established forms of labour that date back beyond the penning of
the decalogue.... This book, and many other Northern school-books
scattered over the country, come within the range of the statutes of this
State, which provide for the imprisonment for life or the infliction of the
penalty of death upon any person who shall ‘publish or distribute’ such
works; and were I a citizen of New Orleans, this work should not escape
the attention of the grand jury. But need I add more to convince the
sceptical of the necessity there is for the production of our own text-books,
and, may I not add, our own literature? Why should the land of domestic
servitude be less productive in the great works of the mind now than when
Homer evoked the arts, poetry, and eloquence into existence? Moses
wrote the Genesis of Creation, the Exodus of Israel, and the laws of mankind?
and when Cicero, Virgil, Horace, St. John, and St. Paul became the
instructors of the world?<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>... They will want no cut-throat
literature, no fire-brand moral science ... nor Appleton’s ‘Complete
Atlas,’ to encourage crimes that would blanch the cheek of a pirate, nor
any of the ulcerous and polluting agencies issuing from the hot-beds of
abolition fanaticism.”</p>

<p>From an article on educational reform at the South, in
the same “Review,” 1856, I take the following indications of
what, among other Northern doings, are considered to imperil
the South:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘Lovell’s United States Speaker,’ the ‘National Reader,’ the ‘Young
Ladies’ Reader,’ ‘Columbian Orator,’ ‘Scott’s Lessons,’ the ‘Village
Reader,’ and numerous others, have been used for years, and are all, in
some respects, valuable compilations. We apprehend, however, there are
few parents or teachers who are familiar with the whole of their contents,
or they would demand expurgated editions for the use of their children.
<i>The sickly sentimentality of the poet Cowper</i>, whose ear became so ‘pained,’
and his soul ‘sick with every day’s report of wrong and outrage,’ that it
made him cry out in agony for ‘a lodge in some vast wilderness,’ where
he might commune with howling wolves and panthers on the blessings of
<i>liberty</i> (?), stamps its infectious poison upon many of the pages of these
works.”...</p>

<p>“From the American First Class Book, page 185, we quote another
more modern sentiment, which bears no less higher authority than the
name of the great Massachusetts statesman, Mr. Webster:”</p>
</div>

<p>Having burnt or expurgated Webster and Cowper, is it
to be imagined that the leaders of opinion in the South
would yet be willing to permit familiar intercourse between
themselves and a people who allowed a book containing ‘Such
lines as these to circulate freely?—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="i4">“What is a man</p>

<p>What a dangerous sentiment to come by any chance to a
slave! Is it not? Are you, then, prepared to burn your
Shakespeare? I will not ask if you will have another book
“expurgated,” of all passages the tendency of which is to
set the bondmen free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span></p>

<p>If the security of life and property at the South must for
ever be dependent on the thoroughness with which the negro
population is prevented from acquiring knowledge; from
thinking of themselves and for themselves, it will never be felt
to be greater than it is to-day. Efforts made to increase
this security will of themselves occasion agitation, and
agitation must counteract those efforts. Knowledge, knowledge
of what is going on elsewhere, of the condition of men
elsewhere, of what is thought elsewhere, must have increased
currency with every class of mankind in all parts of this
continent, as it increases in population, and the movements
of its population increase in activity and importance. No
human laws, embargoes, or armies and navies can prevent it.
Do our utmost, we cannot go back of the steam-engine, the
telegraph, the cotton-gin, and the cylinder press. The
South has admitted steamboats and railroads. It was not
practicable to stop with these, and bar out all the rest that
is peculiar to the nineteenth century. Is it practicable to
admit the machinery of modern civilized life, and not stir
up its free people? Is it practicable to stir up its intermediate
class, and keep its lowest torpid? Assuredly the
security which depends upon preventing either of these steps
can never be permanently increased; spite of all possible
further extension of slave territory, and dispersion and disconnection
of plantations, it must gradually lessen. As it
lessens, the demand upon the nation to supply new grounds
of security must increase—increase continually, until at
length, this year, next year, or another, they conclusively
and hopelessly fail. It may cost us much or it may cost us
little to reach that point, but it is inevitably to be reached.
It may be after long and costly civil war, or longer and more
costly foreign wars, or it may be peaceably, sensibly, and
soon, but it must come. The annexation of Cuba, international<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
fugitive slave laws,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> the African slave trade, judgments
of the Supreme Court, and whatever else may be first asked
and given, will not prevent it—nothing the North will do,
nothing the North can do, will prevent it. The proximity of
a people who cannot hold labour in contempt; who cannot
keep labourers in ignorance and permanent dependence each
upon another man; who cannot have an effective censorship
of the press, or a trustworthy army of <i>mouchards</i>, prevents,
and must always prevent, the South from standing with
the slightest confidence of safety on that policy which it
proclaims to be its only ground of safety. Nothing but a
reversal of the current of our Northern history for half a
century, nothing, in fact, but the enslavement of labour at
the North, could in the nature of things, give that security,
even temporarily, to the capitalists of labour at the South
which they need.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Some demand of the South upon the nation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
acquiescence in which it holds essential to its safety,
must then at length be distinctly refused. And when, ten
or twenty years hence, if so be, this shall come to pass, what
then is to happen to us?</p>

<p>Dissolution?</p>

<p>This is what many Southern politicians avow, whenever
they contemplate such a contingency.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because it is known that the people of the North are unwilling
that the Union should be dissolved, whereas they have
no indisposition to the only course which it will then be possible
for the South to adopt, for the sake of increasing the security
of its citizens, against insurrectionary movements of its slaves.
This plainly would be to arrange a systematic opportunity
and method for the slaves to labour, whenever they chose,
and as much as they might choose, in an orderly, peaceable,
and wise way, for their own release and improvement, each
man for himself and those most dear to him; each man by
himself, independently, openly, with no occasion for combination,
secrecy, plots, or conspiracy. To prepare, for those
disposed to avail themselves of it, a field, either here or
elsewhere, in which their capability and Godlike reason,
such as it may be, little or great, need not be forced by law to
rust unused, or brighten <i>only</i> to the material advantage of
a master. This I must think to be consciously, even now,
the only final course of safety before every reflective Southern
mind. This, or——dissolution, and the chances of war.</p>

<span class="s08">THE CONDITION OF VIRGINIA.—STATISTICS.</span></h2>

<p class="center">1.</p>

<p>The <i>Richmond Enquirer</i>, a strong and influential pro-slavery
newspaper of Virginia, in advocating some railroad projects,
thus describes the progress of the State relatively to that of
some of the Free States, since the Revolution. (Dec. 29, 1852.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Virginia, anterior to the Revolution, and up to the adoption of the
Federal Constitution, contained more wealth and a larger population
than any other State of this Confederacy. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Virginia, from being first in point of wealth and political power,
has come down to the fifth in the former, and the fourth in the latter.
New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Ohio stand above her in
wealth, and all, but Massachusetts, in population and political power.
Three of these States are literally chequered over with railroads and
canals; and the fourth (Massachusetts) with railroads alone. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>

<p>“But when we find that the population of the single city of New
York and its environs exceeds the whole free population of Eastern
Virginia, and the valley between the Blue Ridge and Alleghany, we
have cause to feel deeply for our situation. Philadelphia herself contains
a population far greater than the whole free population of Eastern Virginia.
The little State of Massachusetts has an aggregate wealth exceeding
that of Virginia by more than one hundred and twenty-six
millions of dollars—a State, too, which is incapable of subsisting its
inhabitants from the production of its soil. And New York, which was
as much below Massachusetts, at the adoption of the Federal Constitution,
in wealth and power, as the latter was below Virginia, now exceeds
the wealth of both. While the aggregate wealth of New York, in 1850,
amounted to $1,080,309,216, that of Virginia was $436,701,082—a
difference in favour of the former of $643,608,134. The unwrought
mineral wealth of Virginia exceeds that of New York. The climate and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
soil are better; the back country, with equal improvements, would
contribute as much.”</p>
</div>

<p>The same journal adds, on another occasion:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In no State of the Confederacy do the facilities for manufacturing
operations exist in greater profusion than in Virginia. Every condition
essential to success in these employments is found here in prodigal
abundance, and in a peculiarly convenient combination. First, we have
a limitless supply of water power—the cheapest of motors—in localities
easy of access. So abundant is this supply of water power that no value
is attached to it distinct from the adjacent lands, except in the vicinity
of the larger towns. On the Potomac and its tributaries; on the Rappahannock;
on the James and its tributaries; on the Roanoke and its
tributaries; on the Holston, the Kanawha, and other streams, numberless
sites may now be found where the supply of water power is sufficient
for the purposes of a Lawrence or a Lowell. Nor is there any
want of material for building at these localities; timber and granite are
abundant; and, to complete the circle of advantages, the climate is
genial and healthful, and the soil eminently productive. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp; Another
advantage which Virginia possesses, for the manufacture of cotton,
is the proximity of its mills to the raw material. At the present prices
of the staple, the value of this advantage is estimated at 10 per cent.”</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Lynchburg Virginian</i>, another newspaper of respectability,
having a similar purpose in hand, namely, to induce capitalists
to invest their money in enterprises that shall benefit the State,
observes that—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The coal fields of Virginia are the most extensive in the world, and
her coal is of the best and purest quality. Her iron deposits are altogether
inexhaustible, and in many instances so pure that it is malleable
in its primitive state; and many of these deposits in the immediate
vicinity of extensive coal-fields. She has, too, very extensive deposits
of copper, lead, and gypsum. Her rivers are numerous and bold, generally
with fall enough for extensive water power.</p>

<p>“A remarkable feature in the mining and manufacturing prospects of
Virginia is, the ease and economy with which all her minerals are
mined; instead of being, as in England and elsewhere, generally imbedded
deep within the bowels of the earth, from which they can be got
only with great labour and at great cost, ours are found everywhere on
the hills and slopes, with their ledges dipping in the direction of the
plains below. Why, then, should not Virginia at once employ at least
half of her labour and capital in mining and manufacturing? Richmond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
could as profitably manufacture all cotton and woollen goods as
Lowell, or any other town in New England. Why should not Lynchburg,
with all her promised facility of getting coal and pig metal, manufacture
all articles of iron and steel just as cheaply, and yet as profitably,
as any portion of the Northern States? Why should not every town
and village on the line of every railroad in the State, erect their shops,
in which they may manufacture a thousand articles of daily consumption,
just as good and cheap as they may be made anywhere? *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Dependent upon Europe and the North for almost every yard of
cloth, and every coat, and boot, and hat we wear; for our axes, scythes,
tubs, and buckets—in short, for everything except our bread and meat!—it
must occur to the South that if our relations with the North should
ever be severed—and how soon they may be, none can know (may God
avert it long!)—we would, in all the South, not be able to clothe ourselves.
We could not fell our forests, plough our fields, nor mow our
meadows. In fact, we would be reduced to a state more abject than we
are willing to look at even prospectively. And yet, with all these
things staring us in the face, we shut our eyes, and go on blindfold.”</p>
</div>

<p>At the Convention for the formation of the Virginia State
Agricultural Society, in 1852, the draft of an address to the
farmers of the State was read, approved, and once adopted by
the Convention. The vote by which it was adopted was soon
afterwards reconsidered, and it was again approved and adopted.
A second time it was reconsidered; and finally it was rejected,
on the ground that there were admissions in it that would feed
the fanaticism of the Abolitionists. No one argued against it on
the ground of the falsity or inaccuracy of these admissions.
Twenty of the most respectable proprietors in the State, immediately
afterwards, believing it to contain “matter of grave import,”
which should not be suppressed for such a reason, united
in requesting a copy of it for publication. In the note of these
gentlemen to the author, they express the belief that Virginia
now “possesses the richest soil, most genial climate, and
cheapest labour on earth.” The author of the address, in his
reply, says: “Fanaticism is a fool for whose vagaries I am not
responsible. I am a pro-slavery man—I believe it, at this time,
impossible to abolish it, and not desirable if it were possible.”</p>

<p>The address was accordingly published, and I make the following
extracts from it:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“ADDRESS TO THE FARMERS OF VIRGINIA.</p>

<p>“‘The Southern States stand foremost in agricultural labour, though
they hold but the third rank in population.’ At the head of these
Southern States, in production, in extent of territory, in climate, in soil,
and in population, stands the Commonwealth of Virginia. She is a
nation of farmers. Eight-tenths of her industry is expended upon the
soil; but less than one-third of her domain is in pasturage, or under the
plough.</p>

<p>“Out of somewhat more than thirty-nine millions of acres, she tills
but little over ten millions of acres, or about twenty-six and a quarter
per cent., whilst New York has subdued about forty-one per cent., or
twelve and a quarter out of her twenty-nine and a half millions of
acres: and Massachusetts, with her sterile soil and inhospitable climate,
has reclaimed from the forest, the quarry, and the marsh, about forty-two
and a half per cent., or two and one-eighth out of her little territory
of five millions of acres. Yet, according to the census of 1840, only
six-tenths of the labour of New York, and four-tenths of that of Massachusetts,
or, relatively, one-fifth and two-fifths less than our own, is
expended upon agriculture. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The live stock of Virginia are worth only three dollars and thirty-one
cents for every arable acre; but in New York they are worth six
dollars and seven cents, and in Massachusetts four dollars and fifty-two
cents.</p>

<p>“The proportion of hay for the same quantity of land is, for Virginia,
eighty-one pounds; for New York, six hundred and seventy-nine
pounds; for Massachusetts, six hundred and eighty-four pounds. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>

<p>“With access to the same markets, and with hundreds of mechanics
of our own, who can vie with the best Northern manufacturers, we find
that our implements are inferior, that the New York farmer spends upon
his nearly three times as much as we do upon ours, and the Massachusetts
farmer more than double. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Manure is indispensable to good husbandry. Judging from the
history of agriculture in all other countries, we may safely say, that
farming can never attain to continued perfection where manure is not
put on with an unsparing hand. By far the larger part of this can only
be made by stock, which should, at the same time, be made the source
of profit, at least sufficient to pay the cost of their keep, so that, <i>other
things being equal</i>, it is a safe rule to estimate the condition of a farming
district by the amount of live stock it may possess, and the provision
made for their sustenance. Applied in this instance, we see that the
New York farmer has invested in live stock two dollars and seventy-six
cents, and the Massachusetts farmer one dollar and twenty-one cents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
per acre more than the Virginia farmer. In pasturage we cannot tell
the difference. It is well, perhaps, for the honour of the State, that we
cannot. But in hay, New York has five hundred and ninety-eight
pounds, and Massachusetts six hundred and three pounds more per acre
than we have. This, however, does not present the true state of the
case. Land-locked by mountain barriers, as yet impassable for the
ordinary agricultural staples, or debarred from their production by
distance and prohibitory rates of transportation, most of the wealth and
exports of many considerable portions of our State consists of live stock
alone. What proportion these parts bear to the whole, we have been
unable definitely to ascertain; but it is, no doubt, so great as to warrant
us in assuming a much more considerable disparity than the statistics
show in the live stock of the whole Atlantic slope, as compared with
New York and Massachusetts. And we shall appreciate, still more
highly, the skill of the Northern farmer, if we reflect that a readier
market for every, the most trivial, product of his farm, operates as
a constant temptation to break up his rotation and diminish his stock.</p>

<p>“In the above figures, carefully calculated from the data of authentic
documents,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> we find no cause for self-gratulation, but some food for
meditation. They are not without use to those who would improve the
future by the past. They show that we have not done our part in the
bringing of land into cultivation; that, notwithstanding natural advantages
which greatly exceed those of the two States drawn into parallel
with Virginia, we are yet behind them both—that with forty and sixty
per cent. respectively of their industry devoted to other pursuits, into
which it has been lured by prospects of greater gain, they have done
more than we have done. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Whilst our population has increased for the last ten years, in a
ratio of 11·66, that of New York has increased in a ratio of 27·52, and
that of Massachusetts at the still heavier and more startling rate of
34·81. With a territorial area thirty per cent. larger than New York,
we have but little more than one-third of her Congressional representation;
and Massachusetts, only one-eighth our size, comes within two of
our number of representatives, we being cut down to thirteen, while she
rises to eleven. And thus we, who once swayed the councils of the
Union, find our power gone, and our influence on the wane, at a time
when both are of vital importance to our prosperity, if not to our safety.
As other States accumulate the means of material greatness, and glide
past us on the road to wealth and empire, we slight the warnings of dull
statistics, and drive lazily along the field of ancient customs, or stop the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
<i>plough</i>, to speed the <i>politician</i>—should we not, in too many cases, say
with more propriety, the <i>demagogue</i>?</p>

<p>“State pride is a good thing; it is one mode in which patriotism is
manifested. But it is not always a wise one. Certainly not, when it
makes us content on small grounds. And when it smothers up improvement
in self-satisfaction, it is a most pernicious thing. We have
much to be proud of in Virginia. In intellect and fitness to command,
in personal and social qualities, in high tone and noble bearing, in
loyalty, in generosity, and magnanimity, and disinterestedness, above
all, in moral purity, we once stood—let us hope, still stand—preeminent
among our sister States. But the possession and practice of
these virtues do not comprise our whole duty as men or as citizens.
The great decree which has gone forth ordaining that we shall ‘increase,
and multiply, and replenish the earth,’ enjoins upon us quite other
duties, which cannot be neglected with impunity; so we have found out
by experience—for we <i>have</i> neglected these duties. And when we
contemplate our field of labour, and the work we have done in it, we
cannot but observe the sad contrast between capacity and achievement.
With a wide-spread domain, with a kindly soil, with a climate whose
sun radiates fertility, and whose very dews distil abundance, we find our
inheritance so wasted that the eye aches to behold the prospect.”</p>

<p>Considering that, at the Revolution, Virginia had nearly twice
the population of Pennsylvania, was in possession of much more
wealth or disposable capital, and had much the best natural
facilities for external commerce and internal communication, if
her political and social constitution had been and had continued
equally good, and her people equally industrious and enterprising
with those of Pennsylvania, there is no reason why the
value of her farms should not have been, at this time, at least
equal to those of Pennsylvania. Were it so, it appears that
Virginia, in that particular alone, would now be richer than
she is by four hundred and thirty millions of dollars.</p>

<p>If it should be thought that this difference between the value<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
of land in Virginia and Pennsylvania is in some degree due to
more fertile soils in the latter, a similar comparison may be
made with the other adjoining Free State, and old State of New
Jersey, the climate of which, owing to its vicinity to the ocean,
differs imperceptibly from that of Virginia, while its soil is
decidedly less fertile, taking both States on an average. The
average value of farming-land in New Jersey is recorded at
$44.</p>

<p>Give this value to the Virginia farms, and the difference
between it and their present value would buy, at a large valuation,
all the slaves now in the State, send them to Africa,
provide each family of them five hundred dollars to start with
when they reached there, and leave still a surplus which, divided
among the present white population of the State, would give
between two and three thousand dollars to each family.</p>

<p>Some Southern writers have lately objected to comparisons
of density of population, as indications of the prosperity of
communities. Between two adjoining communities, however,
where there are no restrictions upon the movements of the populations,
and when the people are so ready to move as both those
of Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, and of Virginia have shown
themselves to be, the price of land must indicate with considerable
exactness the comparative value or desirableness of it, all
things considered, to live upon. The Virginians do not admit,
and have no occasion to do so, that Pennsylvania and New
Jersey have any advantage over Virginia, in soil, in climate, or
in any natural quality.</p>

<p class="center">3.</p>

<p>In intellectual productions, the same general comparative
barrenness is noticeable.</p>

<p>“We receive nearly all our books from Northern or foreign authors—gotten
up, printed by Northern or foreign publishers—while we have
among us numberless men of ripe scholarship, profound acquirements,
elegant and forcible writers—men willing to devote themselves to such
labour, <i>only a Southern book is not patronized</i>. The North usually
scowls at it, ridicules it, or damns it with faint praise; and the South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
takes on a like hue and complexion and neglects it. We have printers
and publishers able, willing, and competent to publish, but, such is the
<i>apathy</i> on the part of Southern people, that it involves hazard to
Southern publishers to put them out. Indeed, until recently, almost
all the publications, even of Southern books, issued (and that was their
only hope of success) from Northern houses. The last chance now of
getting a Southern book sold, is to manage to secure the favourable
notice of the Northern press, and then the South buys it. Our magazines
and periodicals languish for support.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Howison, “The Virginia Historian,” observes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The question might be asked, Where is the literature of Virginia?
and it would not be easily answered. It is a melancholy fact, that her
people have never been a reading people. In the mass they have shown
an indifference to polite literature and education in general, depressing to
the mind that wishes to see them respectable and happy.”</p>
</div>

<p>“It is with pain,” says the same authority, “that we are compelled
to speak of the horrible cloud of ignorance that rests on
Virginia,” and he computes that (1848) there are in the State
166,000 youth, between seven and sixteen years of age, and of
these 126,000 attend no school at all, and receive no education
except what can be imparted by poor and ignorant parents.
Besides these, he reckons 449,087 slaves and 48,852 free
negroes, with few exceptions, wholly uneducated.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The policy which discourages further extension of knowledge among
them is necessary: but the fact remains unchanged, that they exist
among us, <i>a huge mass of mind, almost entirely unenlightened</i>. We
fear that the most favourable estimates will leave, in our State, 683,000
rational beings who are destitute of the merest rudiments of knowledge.”</p>

<span class="s08">THE SLAVE TRADE IN VIRGINIA.</span></h2>

<p class="center"><i>From Chambers’s Journal.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The exposure of ordinary goods in a store is not more open to the
public than are the sales of slaves in Richmond. By consulting the
local newspapers, I learned that the sales take place by auction every
morning in the offices of certain brokers, who, as I understood by the
terms of their advertisements, purchased or received slaves for sale on
commission.</p>

<p>“Where the street was in which the brokers conducted their business,
I did not know; but the discovery was easily made. Rambling
down the main street in the city, I found that the subject of my search
was a narrow and short thoroughfare, turning off to the left, and
terminating in a similar cross thoroughfare. Both streets, lined with
brick houses, were dull and silent. There was not a person to whom I
could put a question. Looking about, I observed the office of a commission
agent, and into it I stepped. Conceive the idea of a large shop
with two windows, and a door between; no shelving or counters inside;
the interior a spacious, dismal apartment, not well swept; the only
furniture a desk at one of the windows, and a bench at one side of the
shop, three feet high, with two steps to it from the floor. I say, conceive
the idea of this dismal-looking place, with nobody in it but three
negro children, who, as I entered, were playing at auctioneering each
other. An intensely black little negro, of four or five years of age, was
standing on the bench, or block, as it is called, with an equally black
girl, about a year younger, by his side, whom he was pretending to sell
by bids to another black child, who was rolling about the floor.</p>

<p>“My appearance did not interrupt the merriment. The little
auctioneer continued his mimic play, and appeared to enjoy the joke of
selling the girl, who stood demurely by his side.</p>

<p>“‘Fifty dolla for de gal—fifty dolla—fifty dolla—I sell dis here fine
gal for fifty dolla,’ was uttered with extraordinary volubility by the
woolly-headed urchin, accompanied with appropriate gestures, in imitation,
doubtless, of the scenes he had seen enacted daily on the spot. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
spoke a few words to the little creatures, but was scarcely understood
and the fun went on as if I had not been present: so I left them, happy
in rehearsing what was likely soon to be their own fate.</p>

<p>“At another office of a similar character, on the opposite side of the
street, I was more successful. Here, on inquiry, I was respectfully informed,
by a person in attendance, that the sale would take place the
following morning at half-past nine o’clock.</p>

<p>“Next day I set out accordingly, after breakfast, for the scene of
operations, in which there was now a little more life. Two or three
persons were lounging about, smoking cigars; and, looking along the
street, I observed that three red flags were projected from the doors of
those offices in which sales were to occur. On each flag was pinned a
piece of paper, notifying the articles to be sold. The number of lots
was not great. On the first was the following announcement:—‘Will
be sold this morning, at half-past nine o’clock, a Man and a Boy.’</p>

<p>“It was already the appointed hour; but as no company had assembled,
I entered and took a seat by the fire. The office, provided
with a few deal forms and chairs, a desk at one of the windows, and a
block accessible by a few steps, was tenantless, save by a gentleman
who was arranging papers at the desk, and to whom I had addressed
myself on the previous evening. Minute after minute passed, and still
nobody entered. There was clearly no hurry in going to business. I
felt almost like an intruder, and had formed the resolution of departing,
in order to look into the other offices, when the person referred to left
his desk, and came and seated himself opposite to me at the fire.</p>

<p>“‘You are an Englishman,’ said he, looking me steadily in the face;
‘do you want to purchase?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ I replied, ‘I am an Englishman; but I do not intend to
purchase. I am travelling about for information, and I shall feel
obliged by your letting me know the prices at which negro servants are
sold.’</p>

<p>“‘I will do so with much pleasure,’ was the answer; ‘do you mean
field-hands or house-servants?’</p>

<p>“‘All kinds,’ I replied; ‘I wish to get all the information I can.’</p>

<p>“With much politeness, the gentleman stepped to his desk, and
began to draw up a note of prices. This, however, seemed to require
careful consideration; and while the note was preparing, a lanky person,
in a wide-awake hat, and chewing tobacco, entered, and took the chair
just vacated. He had scarcely seated himself, when, on looking towards
the door, I observed the subjects of sale—the man and boy indicated by
the paper on the red flag—enter together, and quietly walk to a form
at the back of the shop, whence, as the day was chilly, they edged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
themselves towards the fire, in the corner where I was seated. I was now
between the two parties—the white man on the right, and the old and
young negro on the left—and I waited to see what would take place.</p>

<p>“The sight of the negroes at once attracted the attention of Wide-awake.
Chewing with vigour, he kept keenly eyeing the pair, as if to
see what they were good for. Under this searching gaze, the man and
boy were a little abashed, but said nothing. Their appearance had
little of the repulsiveness we are apt to associate with the idea of slaves.
They were dressed in a gray woollen coat, pants, and waistcoat, coloured
cotton neckcloths, clean shirts, coarse woollen stockings, and stout
shoes. The man wore a black hat; the boy was bareheaded. Moved
by a sudden impulse, Wide-awake left his seat, and rounding the back
of my chair, began to grasp at the man’s arms, as if to feel their
muscular capacity. He then examined his hands and fingers; and, last
of all, told him to open his mouth and show his teeth, which he did in
a submissive manner. Having finished these examinations, Wide-awake
resumed his seat, and chewed on in silence as before.</p>

<p>“I thought it was but fair that I should now have my turn of investigation,
and accordingly asked the elder negro what was his age. He
said he did not know. I next inquired how old the boy was. He said
he was seven years of age. On asking the man if the boy was his son,
he said he was not—he was his cousin. I was going into other particulars,
when the office-keeper approached, and handed me the note he
had been preparing; at the same time making the observation that the
market was dull at present, and that there never could be a more
favourable opportunity of buying. I thanked him for the trouble
which he had taken; and now submit a copy of his price-current:</p>

<p>“Leaving this document for future consideration, I pass on to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
history of the day’s proceedings. It was now ten minutes to ten o’clock,
and Wide-awake and I being alike tired of waiting, we went off in quest
of sales further up the street. Passing the second office, in which also
nobody was to be seen, we were more fortunate at the third. Here
according to the announcement on the paper stuck to the flag, there
were to be sold, ‘A woman and three children; a young woman, three
men, a middle-aged woman, and a little boy.’ Already a crowd had
met, composed, I should think, of persons mostly from the cotton-plantations
of the South. A few were seated near a fire on the right-hand
side, and others stood round an iron stove in the middle of the
apartment. The whole place had a dilapidated appearance. From a
back window, there was a view into a ruinous court-yard; beyond
which, in a hollow, accessible by a side lane, stood a shabby brick house,
on which the word <i>Jail</i> was inscribed in large black letters on a white
ground. I imagined it to be a depôt for the reception of negroes.</p>

<p>“On my arrival, and while making these preliminary observations,
the lots for sale had not made their appearance. In about five minutes
afterwards, they were ushered in, one after the other, under the charge
of a mulatto, who seemed to act as principal assistant. I saw no whips,
chains, or any other engine of force. Nor did such appear to be
required. All the lots took their seats on two long forms near the
stove; none showed any signs of resistance; nor did any one utter a
word. Their manner was that of perfect humility and resignation.</p>

<p>“As soon as all were seated, there was a general examination of their
respective merits, by feeling their arms, looking into their mouths, and
investigating the quality of their hands and fingers—this last being
evidently an important particular. Yet there was no abrupt rudeness in
making these examinations—no coarse or domineering language was
employed. The three negro men were dressed in the usual manner—in
gray woollen clothing. The woman, with three children, excited my
peculiar attention. She was neatly attired, with a coloured handkerchief
bound around her head, and wore a white apron over her gown.
Her children were all girls, one of them a baby at the breast three
months old, and the others two and three years of age respectively,
rigged out with clean white pinafores. There was not a tear or an
emotion visible in the whole party. Everything seemed to be considered
as a matter of course; and the change of owners was possibly
looked forward to with as much indifference as ordinary hired servants
anticipate a removal from one employer to another.</p>

<p>“While intending purchasers were proceeding with personal examinations
of the several lots, I took the liberty of putting a few questions
to the mother of the children. The following was our conversation:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span></p>

<p>“‘Are you a married woman?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘How many children have you had?’</p>

<p>“‘Seven.’</p>

<p>“‘Where is your husband?’</p>

<p>“‘In Madison county.’</p>

<p>“‘When did you part from him?’</p>

<p>“‘On Wednesday—two days ago.’</p>

<p>“‘Were you sorry to part from him?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir,’ she replied, with a deep sigh; ‘my heart was a’most
broke.’</p>

<p>“‘Why is your master selling you?’</p>

<p>“‘I don’t know—he wants money to buy some land—suppose he
sells me for that.’</p>

<p>“There might not be a word of truth in these answers, for I had no
means of testing their correctness; but the woman seemed to speak
unreservedly, and I am inclined to think that she said nothing but
what, if necessary, could be substantiated. I spoke, also, to the young
woman who was seated near her. She, like the others, was perfectly
black, and appeared stout and healthy, of which some of the persons
present assured themselves by feeling her arms and ankles, looking into
her mouth, and causing her to stand up. She told me she had several
brothers and sisters, but did not know where they were. She said she
was a house-servant, and would be glad to be bought by a good master—looking
at me, as if I should not be unacceptable.</p>

<p>“I have said that there was an entire absence of emotion in the looks
of men, women, and children, thus seated preparatory to being sold.
This does not correspond with the ordinary accounts of slave-sales,
which are represented as tearful and harrowing. My belief is, that
none of the parties felt deeply on the subject, or at least that any
distress they experienced was but momentary—soon passed away, and
was forgotten. One of my reasons for this opinion rests on a trifling
incident which occurred. While waiting for the commencement of the
sale, one of the gentlemen present amused himself with a pointer dog,
which, at command, stood on its hind legs, and took pieces of bread
from his pocket. These tricks greatly entertained the row of negroes,
old and young; and the poor woman, whose heart three minutes before
was almost broken, now laughed as heartily as any one.</p>

<p>“‘Sale is going to commence—this way, gentlemen,’ cried a man at
the door to a number of loungers outside; and all having assembled, the
mulatto assistant led the woman and her children to the block, which
he helped her to mount. There she stood, with her infant at the breast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
and one of her girls at each side. The auctioneer, a handsome, gentlemanly
personage, took his place, with one foot on an old deal chair with
a broken back, and the other raised on the somewhat more elevated
block. It was a striking scene.</p>

<p>“‘Well, gentlemen,’ began the salesman, ‘here is a capital woman
and her three children, all in good health—what do you say for them?
Give me an offer. (Nobody speaks.) I put up the whole lot at 850
dollars—850 dollars—850 dollars (speaking very fast)—850 dollars.
Will no one advance upon that? A very extraordinary bargain, gentlemen.
A fine, healthy baby. Hold it up. (Mulatto goes up the first
step of the block; takes the baby from the woman’s breast, and holds it
aloft with one hand, so as to show that it was a veritable sucking baby.)
That will do. A woman, still young, and three children, all for 850
dollars. An advance, if you please, gentlemen. (A voice bids 860.)
Thank you, sir, 860; any one bids more? (A second voice says, 870;
and so on the bidding goes as far as 890 dollars, when it stops.) That
won’t do, gentlemen. I cannot take such a low price. (After a pause,
addressing the mulatto): She may go down.’ Down from the block
the woman and her children were therefore conducted by the assistant,
and, as if nothing had occurred, they calmly resumed their seats by the
stove.</p>

<p>“The next lot brought forward was one of the men. The assistant
beckoning to him with his hand, requested him to come behind a
canvas screen, of two leaves, which was standing near the back window.
The man placidly rose, and having been placed behind the screen, was
ordered to take off his clothes, which he did without a word or look of
remonstrance. About a dozen gentlemen crowded to the spot while the
poor fellow was stripping himself, and as soon as he stood on the floor,
bare from top to toe, a most rigorous scrutiny of his person was instituted.
The clear black skin, back and front, was viewed all over for
sores from disease; and there was no part of his body left unexamined.
The man was told to open and shut his hands, asked if he could pick
cotton, and every tooth in his head was scrupulously looked at. The
investigation being at an end, he was ordered to dress himself; and
having done so, was requested to walk to the block.</p>

<p>The ceremony of offering him for competition was gone through as
before, but no one would bid. The other two men, after undergoing
similar examinations behind the screen, were also put up, but with the
same result. Nobody would bid for them, and they were all sent back
to their seats. It seemed as if the company had conspired not to buy
anything that day. Probably some imperfections had been detected in
the personal qualities of the negroes. Be this as it may, the auctioneer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
perhaps a little out of temper from his want of success, walked off to his
desk, and the affair was so far at an end.</p>

<p>“‘This way, gentlemen—this way!’ was heard from a voice outside,
and the company immediately hived off to the second establishment.
At this office there was a young woman, and also a man, for sale. The
woman was put up first at 500 dollars; and possessing some recommendable
qualities, the bidding for her was run as high as 710 dollars,
at which she was knocked down to a purchaser. The man, after the
customary examination behind the screen, was put up at 700 dollars;
but a small imperfection having been observed in his person, no one
would bid for him; and he was ordered down.</p>

<p>“‘This way, gentlemen, this way—down the street, if you please!’
was now shouted by a person in the employment of the first firm, to
whose office all very willingly adjourned—one migratory company, it
will be perceived, serving all the slave-auctions in the place. In going
in the crowd, I went to see what should be the fate of the man and boy,
with whom I had already had some communication.</p>

<p>“There the pair, the two cousins, sat by the fire, just where I had
left them an hour ago. The boy was put up first.</p>

<p>“‘Come along, my man—jump up; there’s a good boy!’ said one of
the partners, a bulky and respectable looking person, with a gold chain
and bunch of seals; at the same time getting on the block. With
alacrity the little fellow came forward, and, mounting the steps, stood
by his side. The forms in front were filled by the company; and as I
seated myself, I found that my old companion, Wide-awake, was close
at hand, still chewing and spitting at a great rate.</p>

<p>“‘Now, gentlemen,’ said the auctioneer, putting his hand on the
shoulder of the boy, ‘here is a very fine boy, seven years of age,
warranted sound—what do you say for him? I put him up at 500
dollars—500 dollars (speaking quick, his right hand raised up, and
coming down on the open palm of his left)—500 dollars. Any one say
more than 500 dollars? (560 is bid.) 560 dollars. Nonsense! Just
look at him. See how high he is. (He draws the lot in front of him,
and shows that the little fellow’s head comes up to his breast.) You see
he is a fine, tall, healthy boy. Look at his hands.’</p>

<p>“Several step forward, and cause the boy to open and shut his hands—the
flexibility of the small fingers, black on the one side, and whitish
on the other, being well looked to. The hands, and also the mouth,
having given satisfaction, an advance is made to 570, then to 580
dollars.</p>

<p>“‘Gentlemen, that is a very poor price for a boy of this size. (Addressing
the lot)—Go down, my boy, and show them how you can run.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span></p>

<p>“The boy, seemingly happy to do as he was bid, went down from the
block, and ran smartly across the floor several times; the eyes of every
one in the room following him.</p>

<p>“‘Now that will do. Get up again. (Boy mounts the block, the
steps being rather deep for his short legs; but the auctioneer kindly
lends him a hand.) Come, gentlemen, you see this is a first-rate lot.
(590—600—610—620—630 dollars are bid.) I will sell him for 630
dollars. (Right hand coming down on left.) Last call. 630 dollars,
once—630 dollars, twice. (A pause; hand sinks.) Gone!’</p>

<p>“The boy having descended, the man was desired to come forward;
and after the usual scrutiny behind a screen, he took his place on the
block.</p>

<p>“‘Well, now, gentlemen,’ said the auctioneer, ‘here is a right prime
lot. Look at this man; strong, healthy, able-bodied; could not be a
better hand for field-work. He can drive a waggon or anything.
What do you say for him? I offer the man at the low price of 800
dollars—he is well worth 1200 dollars. Come, make an advance, if you
please. 800 dollars said for the man (a bid); thank you; 810 dollars—810
dollars—810 dollars (several bids)—820—830—850—860—going
at 860—going. Gentlemen, this is far below his value. A strong-boned
man, fit for any kind of heavy work. Just take a look at him.
(Addressing the lot): Walk down. (Lot dismounts, and walks from
one side of the shop to the other. When about to reascend the block, a
gentleman, who is smoking a cigar, examines his mouth with his fingers.
Lot resumes his place.) Pray, gentlemen, be quick (continues the
auctioneer); I must sell him, and 860 dollars are only bid for the man—860
dollars. (A fresh run of bids to 945 dollars.) 945 dollars, once—945
dollars, twice (looking slowly round, to see if all were done), 945
dollars. Going—going—(hand drops)—gone!’</p>

<p>“Such were a forenoon’s experiences in the slave-market of Richmond.
Everything is described precisely as it occurred, without passion
or prejudice. It would not have been difficult to be sentimental on a
subject which appeals so strongly to the feelings, but I have preferred
telling the simple truth. In a subsequent chapter I shall endeavour to
offer some general views of slavery in its social and political relations.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="APPENDIX_C">APPENDIX (C.)<br>
<span class="s08">COST OF LABOUR IN THE BORDER STATES.</span></h2>

<p>From a native Virginian, who has resided in New York:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“<i>To the Editor of the N. Y. Daily Times.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>—You will not object, I think, to receive an endorsement from
a Southern man, of the statements contained in number seven of ‘Letters
on the Productions, Industry, and Resources of the Southern States’ [by
Mr. Olmsted], published in your issue on Thursday last *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Where you would see one white labourer on a Northern farm, scores
of blacks should appear on the Virginian plantation, <i>the best of them
only performing each day one-fourth a white man’s daily task, and all
requiring an incessant watch to get even this small modicum of labour</i>.
Yet they eat as much again as a white man, must have their two suits
of clothes and shoes yearly, and although the heartiest, healthiest looking
men and women anywhere on earth, actually lose for their owners
or employers one-sixth their time on account of real or pretended sickness.
Be assured, our model Virginia farmer has his hands full, and is
not to be envied as a jolly fox-hunting idler, lording it over ‘ranks of
slaves in chains.’ No, sir; he must be up by ‘the dawn’s early light,’
and head the column, direct in person the commencing operations,
urging, and coaxing; must praise and punish—but too glad to reward
the meritorious, granting liberty (<i>i. e.</i> leave of absence) often to his
own servant, that he dare not take himself, because he must not leave
home for fear something will go wrong ere his return. Hence but too
many give up, to overseers or other irresponsible persons, the care and
management of their estates, rather than undergo such constant annoyance
and confinement. Poor culture, scanty crops, and worn-out land,
is the inevitable result; and yet, harassed and trammeled as they are,
no one but a Southerner regards them with the slightest degree of compassion
or even forbearance; and our good friends, the Abolitionists,
would have ‘all the rest of mankind’ rank them with pirates and cut-throats.
But my object in this communication is not to sympathize
with nor ask sympathy on behalf of slaveholders. For, however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
sinning or sinned against, they seem quite able to take their own part,
if molested; and are remarkably indifferent, withal, as to the opinions
expressed by ignorant ranters concerning them.</p>

<p>“If I have the ability, my desire is to draw a parallel between the
state and condition of Northern and Southern farmers and farming.
The Northern farmer does undoubtedly experience a full share of those
troubles and cares attendant even upon the most easy and favourable
system of farming; but, sir, can he have any such responsibility as that
resting upon the owner of from 50 to 300 ignorant, lazy negroes?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“You must plough deep, follow up quickly, and sow with powerful
fertilizers, attend closely to the growing crop, gather in rapidly before
blight or mildew can come and destroy, says our Northern farmer. On
a farm of three hundred acres, thus managed with five hands, two extra
during harvest, I can raise thirty bushels of wheat to the acre. Now
picture the condition of him South, and hear his answer. With from
three to fifteen hundred acres of land, and a host of negroes great and
small, his cares and troubles are without end. ‘The hands,’ able men
and women, to say nothing of children, and old ones laid by from age
or other infirmity, have wants innumerable. Some are sick, others
pretend to be so, many obstinate, indolent, or fractious—each class
requires different treatment; so that without mentioning the actual
daily wants, as provisions, clothing, etc., etc., the poor man’s time, and
thoughts—indeed, every faculty of mind—must be exercised on behalf
of those who have no minds of their own.</p>

<p>“His answer, then, to the Northern farmer is: ‘I have not one hand
on my place capable and willing to do the work you name.’ They tell
me that ‘five of them could not perform the task required of one.’
They have never been used to do it, and no amount of force or persuasion
will induce them to try. Their task is so much per day; all over
that I agree to pay them for, at the same rate I allow free labourers—but
’tis seldom they make extra time, except to get money enough to
buy tobacco, rum, or sometimes fine clothes. Can it be wondered at
that systematic farming, such as we see North and East, is unknown
or not practised to any great degree South? The two systems will not
harmonize.</p>

<p>From a native New Yorker, who has resided in Virginia:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“<i>To the Editor of the New York Daily Times.</i></p>

<p>“I have read with deep interest the series of letters from the South,
published in your columns. Circumstances have made me quite familiar
with the field of your correspondent’s investigation, much more familiar
than he is at present, and yet I am happy to say, that his letters are
more satisfactory than any I have ever seen relating to the South. It
is now about ten years since, going from this State, I first became familiar
with those facts in regard to the results of slave labour, etc., that
your correspondent and his readers are so much surprised at. I have
talked those subjects over as he is doing, with the planters along the
shores of the Chesapeake, and on both sides of the James River, through
the Tidewater, the middle and the mountainous districts east of the
Blue Ridge, and in many of those rich counties in the Valley of Virginia.
I may add that, subsequently, spending my winters at the
South for my health, I have become well nigh as familiar with the
States of North and South Carolina, and Georgia, as I am with Virginia.
I have, therefore, almost of necessity, given not a little thought to the
questions your correspondent is discussing.</p>

<p>“His statement, in regard to the comparative value of slave and free-labour,
will surprise those who have given little or no attention to the
subject. I wish to confirm his statements on this subject. In Eastern
Virginia I have repeatedly been told that the task of one cord of wood
a day, or five cords a week, rain or shine, is the general task, and one
of the most profitable day’s work that the slave does for his master.
And this, it should be remembered, is generally pine wood, cut from
trees as straight and beautiful as ever grew. The reason of this ‘profitableness’
is the fact that the labour requires so little mental effort.
The grand secret of the difference between free and slave labour is, that
the latter is without intelligence, and without motive. If the former,
in Western New York, has a piece of work to perform, the first thought
is, how it can be done with the least labour, and the most expeditiously.
He thinks, he plans, before he commences, and while about his labour.
His mind labours as much as his body, and this mental labour saves a
vast deal of physical labour. Besides this, he is urged on by the
strongest motives. He enjoys the products of his labour. The more
intelligent and earnest his labours, the richer are his rewards. Slave
labour is exactly the opposite of this. It is unintelligent labour—labour
without thought—without plan—without motive. It is little more
than brute force. To one who has not witnessed it, it is utterly inconceivable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
how little labour a slave, or a company of slaves, will accomplish
in a given time. Their awkwardness, their slowness, the utter
absence of all skill and ingenuity in accomplishing the work before them,
are absolutely painful to one who has been accustomed to seeing work
done with any sort of spirit and life. Often they spend hours in doing
what, with a little thought, might be despatched in a few moments, or
perhaps avoided altogether. This is a necessary result of employing
labour which is without intelligence and without motive. I have often
thought of a remark made to me by a planter, in New Kent County,
Virginia. We were riding past a field where some of his hands were
making a sort of wicker-work fence, peculiar to Eastern Virginia.
‘There,’ said he, in a decidedly fretted tone, ‘those “boys” have been —— days
in making that piece of fence.’ I expressed my astonishment that
they could have spent so much time, and yet have accomplished so very
little. He assured me it was so—and after a slight pause, the tones of
his voice entirely changed, said: ‘Well, I believe they have done as
well as I would in their circumstances!’ And so it is. The slave is
without motive, without inducement to exertion. His food, his clothing,
and all his wants are supplied as they are, without care on his part,
and when these are supplied he has nothing more to hope for. He can
make no provision for old age, he can lay up nothing for his children,
he has no voice at all in the disposal of the results of his earnings.
What cares he whether his labour is productive or unproductive. His
principal care seems to be to accomplish just as little as possible. I
have said that the slaves were without ingenuity—I must qualify that
remark. I have been amused and astonished at their exceeding ingenuity
in avoiding and slighting the work that was required of them.
It has often seemed to me that their principal mental efforts were in
this direction, and I think your correspondent will find universal testimony
that they have decided talent in this line.</p>

<p>In a volume entitled “Notes on Uncle Tom’s Cabin; being
a Logical Answer to its Allegations and Inferences against
Slavery as an Institution,” by the Rev. E. J. Stearns, of Maryland
(much the most thorough review of that work made from
the Southern stand-point), the author, who is a New-Englander
by birth, shows, by an elaborate calculation, that in Maryland,
the cost of a negro, at twenty-one years of age, has been, to the
man who raised him, eight hundred dollars. Six <i>per cent.</i>
interest on this cost, with one and three-quarters per cent. for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
life insurance, per annum, makes the lowest wages of a negro,
under the most favourable circumstances, sixty-two dollars a
year (or five dollars a month), <i>paid in advance</i>, in the shape of
food and clothing. The author, whose object is to prove that
the slaveholder is not guilty, as Mrs. Stowe intimates, of
<i>stealing</i> the negroes’ labour, proceeds, as follows, to show that
he pays a great deal more for it than Mrs. Stowe’s neighbours
in New England do, for the labour they hire:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If now we add to this (what every New-Englander who has lived
at the South <i>knows</i>), that Quashy does not do more than one-third, or,
at the very utmost, one-half as much work as an able-bodied labourer
on a farm at the North; and that, for this he receives, besides the five
dollars above mentioned, his food, clothing, and shelter, with medical
attendance and nursing when sick, and no deduction for lost time, even
though he should be sick for years, while the ‘farm-hand’ at the North
gets only ten or twelve dollars, and has to clothe himself out of it, and
pay his own doctor’s and nurse’s bill in sickness, to say nothing of lost
time, I think we shall come to the conclusion if there has been stealing
anywhere, it has not been from Quashy.”—P. 25.</p>

<p>“I recollect, the first time I saw Quashy at work in the field, I was
struck by the lazy, listless manner in which he raised his hoe. It reminded
me of the working-beam of the engine on the steam-boat that I
had just landed from—fifteen strokes a minute; but there was this difference:
that, whereas the working-beam kept steadily at it, Quashy,
on the contrary, would stop about every five strokes and lean upon his
hoe, and look around, apparently congratulating himself upon the
amount of work he had accomplished.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Stowe may well call Quashy ‘shiftless.’ One of my father’s
hired men—who was with him seven years—did more work in that time
than an average negro would do in his whole life. Nay, I myself have
done more work in a day,—and followed it up, too—than I ever saw
a negro do, and I was considered remarkably lazy with the plough or
hoe.”—P. 142.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="APPENDIX_D">APPENDIX (D.)<br>
<span class="s08">STATISTICS OF THE GEORGIA SEABOARD.</span></h2>

<p>The notes here following are derived from a volume entitled
“White’s Statistics of Georgia,” a large octavo of seven hundred
pages, compiled and published in the State. A special section
of the book is devoted to the condition of the trade of each
county, while a comparison is also attempted to be given, from
the personal observation of the compiler, of the comparative
social, moral, and religious properties of the people. Thus, so
far as the plan has been thoroughly executed, an estimate is presented,
not only of the ordinary commercial demand of the citizens,
but, so to speak, of the state of their intellectual and moral
market.</p>

<p>The counties referred to by Mr. Gregg are in the second tier
from the sea in South Carolina. I shall give statistics from Mr.
White, and other authorities named in the note,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> with regard to
all the second tier counties of Georgia. What of good soil to be
brought into cultivation, without a heavy expenditure at starting,
there was originally in these counties begun to be first occupied
by whites about 1740. It was not till nearly twenty years after
this that slavery obtained the slightest footing in them, and it
was not till about thirty years ago that they had begun to
seriously deteriorate in production. There is yet some rich
land upon the alluvial bottoms of the numerous rivers, which,
rising above, pass through these counties toward the ocean; and
here many wealthy planters still remain, owning a large number
of slaves, and there has been recently a considerable increase of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
production of some parts owing to the employment of capital in
draining marshes, the riches of which have previously been considered
impregnable.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> In general, however, this whole range of
country is now quite barren, and most of the land at present
cultivated will not probably yield one third as large a crop for
the same expenditure of labour as would fair Mississippi cotton
land. The slaves formerly owned here have therefore been very
largely transferred westward, and the land they have worn out is
left for the non-slaveholding whites to make the best of.</p>

<p>As an instructive contrast, I place in an adjoining column
with the statistics of these counties those of the counties which
bound each of them on the east. In these there is a much larger
proportion of rich alluvial soil, and they contain the famous
“sea island” cotton plantations, as well as the Georgian rice
plantations. The valuable soil is still entirely possessed, as
will be evident, by large planters and slave owners, the usual
monopolizing effect of slavery being in this instance increased
by the peculiar local insalubrity of the coast.</p>

<p>Mr. White omits his usual statistics

the adjoining coast county of
Bryan, the poor people, as well as
the planters, are in the habit of
dealing directly with Savannah,
as described in “Seaboard Slave

no established tradesmen in
either.</p></td>

The school fund was once sufficient
to educate many poor children,
but owing to bad management
it has become exhausted.”
Thus says Mr. White. The census
returns show, however, a public
school expenditure of $150 per
annum, and a private expenditure
of $3,000, divided among fifteen
schools, which is one for eighty
square miles. This is so much
better than usual, that, with Mr.
White’s remarks, I am inclined to
think it an error.</p></td>

<td><p><i>Education.</i>—There is no academy,
and there are no schools, except
those supported by the “Poor
School Fund” (a State provision
for the children of indigent parents).
“The children of the
wealthy are either educated by
private teachers or sent to school
in the more favoured portions of
the country; [the vicinity of Savannah,
where there is a celebrated
and well endowed academy, and of
Liberty, where there are others,
accounts for this;] the population
is too sparse to furnish pupils
enough to sustain a regular school”
(large tracts of land being held by
the planters, though wholly unproductive,
to prevent the settlement
of poor whites near their negroes,
as one in this county informed me).
According to the census returns,
there were eight schools (one to
twenty-five square miles) of all
kinds, with an average of twelve
pupils each. Total expenditure for
each school, $38 per annum.

<p>I have purposely omitted Effingham county in the above
arrangement, because the adjoining coast county of Chatham
contains the city of Savannah, an aggregate agency of northern
and foreign merchants, through which is effected the commercial
exchanges of a great extent of back country, the population of
which can therefore afford no indication as to the point under
consideration. Effingham, the county above Chatham, and one
of the second tier, is worthy of notice, from some other important
exceptional features of its constitution. Owing to the
amount of rich soil in the county, along the Savannah river,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span>
there is a larger proportion of slaves to the whole population
than is usual in the second tier, their number being sixteen
hundred against only eighteen hundred whites; the non-slaveholders,
however, appear to possess unusual privileges. There
is an academy, with fifty pupils, which Mr. White describes as
“a fine school.” The public schools, eight in number, are less
than eight miles apart, with an average attendance of sixteen
pupils. Each school costs one hundred and twelve dollars a
year. There are twenty-one churches, less than five miles
apart, and valued at over twelve hundred dollars a-piece. Mr.
White says that honesty and industry are leading characteristics
of the people, who, notwithstanding the poverty of the soil, are
generally in comfortable circumstances.</p>

<p>The reason of this is partially the close vicinity of Savannah,
affording a cash market for a variety of productions and household
manufactures, among which, as distinguishing the county
from any other in the State, are mentioned fruits, silk, fishing
lines, and cow-bells, “the latter,” Mr. White is told, “superior
to any manufactured in the North or in Europe.” But an
equally important reason for the better character and condition
of the people is to be found in the fact that a majority of them<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
are descendants and heirs of the land of those very early settlers
who most strenuously and to the last resisted the introduction
of slaves into the colony, being convinced that, if permitted, it
would, as they said in their memorials, “prove a scourge” to
the poor people who were persuaded to petition for it.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> It is
most gratifying to perceive that all traces of the habits of
industry, honesty, and manly self-reliance, in which they thus
educated their children, are not wholly lost in the lapse of a
century.</p>

to adopt such a system of laws and regulations as will put a stop to the dangerous
practice, heretofore existing, of making advances to planters, in anticipation of
their crops—a practice entirely at variance with everything like safety in business
transactions, and tending directly to establish the relations of master and slave
between the merchant and planter, by bringing the latter into the most abject and
servile bondage.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>,—That this Convention recommend, in the most urgent manner,
that the planters of the Southern and South-western States patronize exclusively
our home merchants, and that our Chambers of Commerce, and merchants generally,
exert all their influence to exclude foreign agents from the purchase and sale
of produce in any of our Southern and South-western cities.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved, further</i>,—That this Convention recommend to the legislatures of the
Southern and South-western States to pass laws, making it a penitentiary offence
for the planters to ask of the merchants to make such pecuniary advances.”</p>

the frame-work of a new building was destroyed by a number of persons, and a
placard attached to the disjointed lumber, stating that a similar course would be
pursued in all cases, against edifices that should be erected by negro contractors or
carpenters, by one of which class of men the house had been constructed. There
was a public meeting called a few days afterwards, to take this outrage into consideration,
which was numerously attended. Resolutions were adopted, denouncing
the act, and the authorities were instructed to offer a suitable reward for the
detection and conviction of the rioters. “The impression was conveyed at the
meeting,” says the <i>Wilmington Herald</i>, “that the act had been committed by
members of an organized association, said to exist here, and to number some two
hundred and fifty persons, and possibly more, who, as was alleged, to right what
they considered a grievance in the matter of negro competition with white labour,
had adopted the illegal course of which the act in question was an illustration.”
Proceedings of a similar significance had occurred at various points, especially in
Virginia.</p>

resolutions, was passed unanimously:</p>

<p>“That the five <i>Christian Advocates</i>, published in the cities of New York,
Pittsburg, Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Chicago, having become Abolition sheets of

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> “<span class="smcap">Fine Prospect for Hay.</span>—While riding by a field the other day, which
looked as rich and green as a New England meadow, we observed to a man sitting
on the fence, ‘You have a fine prospect for hay, neighbour.’ ‘Hay! that’s <i>cotton, sir</i>,’
said he, with an emotion that betrayed an excitement which we cared to provoke
no further; for we had as soon sport with a rattlesnake in the blind days of
August as a farmer at this season of the year, badly in the grass. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>

<p>“All jesting aside, we have never known so poor a prospect for cotton in this
region. In some instances the fields are clean and well worked, but the cotton is
diminutive in size and sickly in appearance. We have seen some fields so foul that
it was almost impossible to tell what had been planted.</p>

<p>“All this backwardness is attributable to the cold, wet weather that we have
had almost constantly since the planting season commenced. When there was a
warm spell, it was raining so that ploughs could not run to any advantage; so,
between the cold and the rain, the cotton crop is very unpromising. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The low, flat lands this year have suffered particularly. Thoroughly saturated
all the time, and often overflowed, the crops on them are small and sickly,
while the weeds and grass are luxurious and rank.</p>

<p>“A week or two of dry hot weather will make a wonderful change in our
agricultural prospects, but we have no idea that any sort of seasons could bring
the cotton to more than an average crop.”—<i>Hernando (Miss.) Advance,
June 22, 1854.</i></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> “Sectional excitement” had given a great impetus to educational projects in
the South, and the Mississippi newspapers about this time contained numerous
advertisements of a similar character to the following:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Calhoun Institute—For Young Ladies; Maçon, Noxubee County,
Mississippi.—W. R. Poindexter</span>, A.M., Principal and Proprietor.—The above
School, formerly known as the ‘Maçon Female Institute,’ will be reopened on the
first of October, 1855, with an entirely new corps of teachers from Principal down.
Having purchased the property at public sale, and thus become <i>sole proprietor</i>,
the Principal has determined to use all means he can now command, as well as
he may realize for several years yet to come, in building, refitting and procuring
such appurtenances as shall enable him to contribute his full quota, as a professional
man, to the progress of the great cause of ‘<span class="smcap">Southern Education</span>.’”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> As “<span class="smcap">A Southern Lawyer</span>,” writing for <i>Harper’s Weekly</i> (February, 1859),
observes: “The sudden acquisition of wealth in the cotton-growing region of the
United States, in many instances by planters commencing with very limited
means, is almost miraculous. Patient, industrious, frugal, and self-denying,
nearly the entire amount of their cotton-crops is devoted to the increase of their
capital. The result is, in a few years large estates, as if by magic, are accumulated.
The fortunate proprietors then build fine houses, and surround themselves
with comforts and luxuries to which they were strangers in their earlier years of
care and toil.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> The following is a characteristic newspaper item of this vicinity:—</p>

<p>From the <i>West Feliciana Whig</i>.—“On Saturday last, a runaway negro was
killed in the parish of East Baton Rouge, just below the line of this parish, under
the following circumstances: Two citizens of Port Hudson, learning that a negro
was at work on a flat boat, loading with sand, just below that place, who was
suspected of being a runaway, went down in a skiff for the purpose of arresting
him.</p>

<p>“Having seized him and put him into the skiff they started back, but had not
proceeded far when the negro, who had been at the oars, seized a hatchet and
assaulted one of them, wounding him very seriously. A scuffle ensued, in which
both parties fell overboard. They were both rescued by the citizen pulling to
them with the skiff. Finding him so unmanageable, the negro was put ashore,
and the parties returned to Port Hudson for arms and a pack of negro dogs, and
started again with the intention to capture him. They soon got on his trail, and
when found again he was standing at bay upon the outer edge of a large raft of
drift wood, armed with a club and pistol.</p>

<p>“In this position he bade defiance to men and dogs—knocking the latter into
the water with his club, and resolutely threatening death to any man who
approached him. Finding him obstinately determined not to surrender, one of his
pursuers shot him. He fell at the third fire, and so determined was he not to be
captured, that when an effort was made to rescue him from drowning he made
battle with his club, and sunk waving his weapon in angry defiance at his
pursuers. He refused to give the name of his owner.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> This may be compared with the town of Springfield, county of Sangammon,
Illinois, in which, with a population of 19,228 (nearer to that of Natchez than
any other town I observe in the Free States), the number of registered school
children is 3,300, the public libraries contain 20,000 volumes, and the churches

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> This would give at this season hardly less than sixteen hours of plodding
labour, relieved by but one short interval of rest, during the daylight, for the hoe-gang.
It is not improbable. I was accustomed to rise early and ride late, resting
during the heat of the day, while in the cotton district, but I always found the
negroes in the field when I first looked out, and generally had to wait for the
negroes to come from the field to have my horse fed when I stopped for the night.
I am told, however, and I believe, that it is usual in the hottest weather, to give
a rest of an hour or two to all hands at noon. I never happened to see it done.

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">[22]</a> In De Bow’s ‘Resources of the South,’ vol. i., p. 150, a table is furnished by a
cotton-planter to show that the expenses of raising cotton are “generally greatly
underrated.” It is to be inferred that they certainly are not underrated in the
table. On “a well improved and properly organized plantation,” the expense of
feeding one hundred negroes, “as deduced from fifteen years’ experience” of the
writer, is asserted in this table to be $750 per annum, or seven dollars and a half
each; in this sum is included, however, the expenses of the “hospital and the
overseer’s table.” This is much less than the expense for the same purposes, if
the overseer’s account was true, of the plantation above described. Clothing, shoes,
bedding, <i>sacks for gathering cotton, and so forth</i>, are estimated by the same
authority to cost an equal sum—$7.50 for each slave. I have just paid on
account of a day labourer on a farm in New York, his board bill, he being a
bachelor living at the house of another Irish labourer with a family. The charge
is twenty-one times as large as that set down for the slave.</p>

ran off before the overseer had chastised him sufficiently for the offence. He was
immediately pursued by the overseer, who succeeded in catching him, when the
negro drew a knife and inflicted a terrible gash in his abdomen. The wounds of
the overseer were dressed by Dr. Stephens, who pronounces it a very critical case,

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[25]</a> Mr. Russell makes an observation to the same effect with regard to the Cuba
plantations, p. 230. On these large cotton plantations there are frequently more
men than women, men being bought in preference to women for cotton picking.</p>

<p>The contrary is usually the case on the small plantations, where the profits of
breeding negroes are constantly in view.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> “A woman, calling herself Violet Ludlow, was arrested a few days ago, and
committed to jail, on the supposition that she was a runaway slave belonging to
A. M. Mobley, of Upshur county, Texas, who had offered through our columns a
reward of fifty dollars for her apprehension. On being brought before a justice of
the peace, she stated that she was a white woman, and claimed her liberty. She
states that she is a daughter of Jeremiah Ludlow, of Pike county, Alabama, and
was brought from that country in 1853, by George Cope, who emigrated to Texas.
After arriving in Texas, she was sold by George Cope to a Doctor Terry, in Upshur
county, Texas, and was soon after sold by him to a Mrs. Hagen, or Hagens, of the
same county. Violet says that she protested against each sale made of her, declaring
herself a free woman. She names George Gilmer, Thomas Rogers, John
Garret, and others, residents of Pike county, Alabama, as persons who have known
her from infancy as the daughter of one Jeremiah Ludlow and Rene Martin, a
widow at the time of her birth, and as being a free white woman, and her father a
free white man. Violet is about instituting legal proceedings for her freedom.”—<i>Shreveport
Southwestern.</i></p>

<p>“Some days since, a woman named Pelasgie was arrested as a fugitive slave,
who has lived for more than twelve years in this city as a free woman. She was
so nearly white that few could detect any traces of her African descent. She was
arrested at the instance of a man named Raby, who claimed her as belonging to an
estate of which he is heir-at-law. She was conveyed to the First District guard-house
for safe keeping, and while there she stated to Acting Recorder Filleul that
she was free, had never belonged to Raby, and had been in the full and unquestioned
enjoyment of her freedom in this city for the above-mentioned period. She also
stated that she had a house, well furnished, which she was in the habit of letting
out in rooms.”—<i>New Orleans Picayune.</i></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> “Bishop Polk, of Louisiana, was one of the guests. He assured me that he
had been all over the country on Red River, the scene of the fictitious sufferings of
‘Uncle Tom,’ and that he had found the temporal and spiritual welfare of the
negroes well cared for. He had confirmed thirty black persons near the situation
assigned to Legree’s estate. He is himself the owner of four hundred slaves,
whom he endeavours to bring up in a religious manner. He tolerates no religion
on his estate but that of the Church. He baptizes all the children, and teaches
them the Catechism. All, without exception, attend the Church service, and the
chanting is creditably performed by them, in the opinion of their owner. Ninety
of them are communicants, marriages are celebrated according to the Church
ritual, and the state of morals is satisfactory. Twenty infants had been baptized
by the bishop just before his departure from home, and he had left his whole
estate, his keys, &amp;c., in the sole charge of one of his slaves, without the slightest
apprehension of loss or damage. In judging of the position of this Christian
prelate as a slave-owner, the English reader must bear in mind that, by the laws
of Louisiana, emancipation has been rendered all but impracticable, and, that, if
practicable, it would not necessarily be, in all cases, an act of mercy or of justice.”—<i>The

“whose accession was an honour to Georgia, and has ever proved one of its
richest blessings.”—In the biography of General Scrivens the county of Liberty is
designated “proud spot, of Georgia’s soil!”—Dr. J. M. B. Harden, in a medical
report of the county, says: “The use of intoxicating drinks has been almost entirely
given up” by its people.—White says (‘Statistics,’ p. 373), “The people of Liberty,
from their earliest settlement, have paid much attention to the subject of
education. Excellent schools are found in different portions of the county, and it
is believed a greater number of young men from Liberty graduate at our colleges
than from any [other] section of Georgia. Indeed, it has been proverbial for furnishing
able ministers and instructors.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Revival among the Slaves.</span>—Rev. J. M. C. Breaker, of Beaufort, S.C.,
writes to the <i>Southern Baptist</i>, that within the last three months he has baptized by
immersion three hundred and fifty persons, <i>all of them, with a few exceptions,
negroes</i>. These conversions were the result of a revival which has been in progress
during the last six months. On the 12th inst., he baptized two hundred and
twenty-three converts—all blacks but three—and the ceremony, although
performed with due deliberation, occupied only one hour and five minutes. This
is nearly four a minute, and Mr. Breaker considers it a demonstration that the
three thousand converted on the day of Pentecost could easily have been baptized
by the twelve apostles—each taking two hundred and fifty—in an hour and
thirteen minutes.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">[33]</a> Twice it happened to come to my knowledge that sons of a planter, by whom
I was lodged while on this journey—lads of fourteen or sixteen—who were supposed
to have slept in the same room with me, really spent the night, till after daybreak,
in the negro cabins. A southern merchant, visiting New York, to whom I expressed
the view I had been led to form of the evil of slavery in this way, replied
that he thought I over-estimated the evil to boys on the plantations, but that it
was impossible to over-estimate it in towns. “I have personal knowledge,” he
continued, “that there are but two lads, sixteen years old, in our town, [a small
market town of Alabama,] who have not already had occasion to resort to remedies
for the penalty of licentiousness.” “When on my brother’s plantation, just before
I came North,” said another Southern merchant, on his annual visit to New York,
“I was informed that each of his family-servants were suffering from ——, and I
ascertained that each of my brother’s children, girls and boys, had been informed
of it, and knew how and from whom it had been acquired. The negroes being
their familiar companions, I tried to get my brother to send them North with me
to school. I told him he might as well have them educated in a brothel at once,
as in the way they were growing up.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="label">[34]</a> Jefferson fails to enumerate, among the evils of slavery, one of its influences
which I am inclined to think as distinct and as baneful to us nationally as any
other. How can men retain the most essential quality of true manhood who
daily, without remonstrance or interference, see men beaten, whose position renders
effective resistance totally impracticable—and not only men, but women, too! Is
it not partially the result of this, that self-respect seldom seems to suggest to an
angry man at the South that he should use anything like magnanimity? that he
should be careful to secure fair play for his opponent in a quarrel? A gentleman
of veracity, now living in the South, told me that among his friends he had once
numbered two young men, who were themselves intimate friends, till one of them,
taking offence at some foolish words uttered by the other, challenged him. A
large crowd assembled to see the duel, which took place on a piece of prairie
ground. The combatants came armed with rifles, and at the first interchange
of shots the challenged man fell disabled by a ball in the thigh. The other, throwing
down his rifle, walked toward him, and kneeling by his side, drew a bowie
knife, and deliberately butchered him. The crowd of bystanders not only permitted
this, but the execrable assassin still lives in the community, has since
married, and, as far as my informant could judge, his social position has been
rather advanced than otherwise, from thus dealing with his enemy. In what
other English—in what other civilized or half-civilized community would such
cowardly atrocity have been endured?</p>

For a number of reasons the practice is a bad one. It is next to impossible to
keep them from working the crop on the Sabbath. They labour at night when
they should be at rest. There is no saving more than to give them the same
amount; for, like all other animals, the negro is only capable of doing a certain
amount of work without injury. To this point he may be worked at his regular
task, and any labour beyond this is an injury to both master and slave. They will
pilfer to add to what cotton or corn they have made. If they sell the crop and
trade for themselves, they are apt to be cheated out of a good portion of their
labour. They will have many things in their possession, under colour of purchases,
which we know not whether they have gained honestly.”—<i>Southern Cultivator.</i></p>

I never saw, during “the famine” in New York, one negro. Five Points Pease
said to me, “The negro seems to be more provident than the Celt. The poor
blacks always manage to keep themselves more decent and comfortable than the
poor whites. They very rarely complain, or ask for charity; and I have often
found them sharing their food with white people, who were too poor to provide for
themselves.” A great deal of falsehood is circulated and accredited about the
sufferings of the free negroes at the North. Their condition is bad enough, but no
worse than that of any men educated and treated as they are, must be; and it is,
on an average, far better than that of the slave.</p>

not having taken pains to collect them for this purpose. In a district of the Slave
States, where it is boasted that more than a hundred bushels of maize to the acre
has been raised, and where not one out of five hundred of the people is engaged in
any other than agricultural industry, I have myself bought maize, which had been
raised by free labour, in Ohio, at two dollars a bushel.</p>

appears that free labour is engaged more profitably in the cultivation of tobacco

others of the Indian labouring classes, perform a day’s work that would terrify a
London porter, or coal-whipper, or a country navvy, or ploughman; and under

mostly on conditions under the control of man, as drainage, the removal of forest
growth—of personal exposure and private hygiene. The climate further north is
too rigid the greater part of the year for personal exposure to the open air, so
essential to the enjoyment of health, and when the extremes are great and rapid,
another class of maladies predominate—the pulmonary, as well as others arising
from crowding, defective ventilation and filth—exacting preventive measures
from the public authorities with as much urgency as the worst fevers of the

<p><a id="Footnote_54" href="#FNanchor_54" class="label">[54]</a> Some one can render a service to civilization by publishing precisely what
feudal rights, so called, were abolished in large parts of Germany and Hungary in
1848, and what results to the commerce of the districts affected the greater
freedom and impulse to industry arising therefrom has had. If I am rightly
informed, trade, in many cases, both export and import, has already much more
than quadrupled in value, thousands of peasants now demanding numerous articles
and being able to pay for them, which before only a few score or hundred proprietors
were expected to buy.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_55" href="#FNanchor_55" class="label">[55]</a> From an “<i>Address on Climatology</i>,” before the Academy of Science, by Dr.
Barton, of New Orleans:—</p>

<p>“The institution of slavery operates by contrast and comparison; it elevates
the tone of the superior, adds to its refinement, allows more time to cultivate the
mind, exalts the standard in morals, manners, and intellectual endowments;
operates as a safety-valve for the evil disposed, leaving the upper race purer,
while it really preserves from degradation, in the scale of civilization, the inferior,
which we see is their uniform destiny when left to themselves. The slaves constitute
essentially the lowest class, and society is immeasurably benefitted by having this
class, which constitutes the offensive fungus—the great cancer of civilized life—a
vast burthen and expense to every community, under surveillance and control;
and not only so, but under direction as an efficient agent to promote the general
welfare and increase the wealth of the community. The history of the world
furnishes no institution under similar management, where so much good actually
results to the governors and the governed as this in the Southern States of North
America.”</p>

<p>“It is by the existence of slavery, exempting so large a portion of our citizens
from labour, that we have leisure for intellectual pursuits.”—<i>Governor Hammond,
in South. Literary Mess.</i></p>

<p>“Would you do a benefit to the horse or the ox, by giving him a cultivated
understanding, or fine feelings? So far as the <i>mere labourer</i> has the pride, the
knowledge, or the aspirations of a free man, he is unfitted for his situation, and
must doubly feel its infelicity. If there are sordid, servile, and laborious offices to be
performed, is it not better that there should be sordid, servile, and laborious beings
to perform them?”—<i>Chancellor Harper; Address to South Carolina Institute.</i></p>

<p>“The relations between the North and the South are very analogous to those
which subsisted between Greece and the Roman Empire, after the subjugation of
Achaia by the Consul Mummius. The dignity and energy of the Roman character,
conspicuous in war and in politics, were not easily tamed and adjusted to the arts of
industry and literature. The degenerate and pliant Greeks, on the contrary, excelled
in the handicraft and polite professions. We learn from the vigorous
invective of Juvenal, that they were the most useful and capable of servants,
whether as pimps or professors of rhetoric. Obsequious, dexterous, and ready, the
versatile Greeks monopolized the business of teaching, publishing, and manufacturing
in the Roman Empire—allowing their masters ample leisure for the
service of the State, in the Senate or in the field.”—<i>Richmond Enquirer.</i></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_56" href="#FNanchor_56" class="label">[56]</a> The business committee of the South Carolina State Agricultural Society
reported, Aug. 9, 1855:—</p>

<p>“Our old fields are enlarging, our homesteads have been decreasing fearfully
in number. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp; We are not only losing some of our most energetic and useful
citizens to supply the bone and sinew of other States, but we are losing our slave
population, which is the true wealth of the State, our stocks of hogs, horses, mules,
and cattle are diminishing in size and decreasing in number, and our purses are
strained for the last cent to supply their places from the North-western States.”</p>

<p>The ability to
merely read and write may itself be of little value, but the fact of a child’s having
had the painstaking necessary to so far instruct him is in some degree a means of
measuring his other inherited wealth, and thus his breeding.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_67" href="#FNanchor_67" class="label">[67]</a> The late Mr. Brooks’ character should be honestly considered, now that
personal enmity toward him is impossible. That he was courteous, accomplished,
warm-hearted, and hot-blooded, dear as a friend and fearful as an enemy, may be
believed by all; but, in the South, his name is yet never mentioned without the term
gallant or courageous, spirited or noble, is also attached to it; and we are obliged
to ask, why insist on this? The truth is, we include a habit of mind in these
terms which slavery has rendered, in a great degree, obsolete in the South. The
man who has been accustomed from childhood to see men beaten when they have
no chance to defend themselves; to hear men accused, reproved, vituperated, who
dare not open their lips in self-defence or reply; the man who is accustomed to
see other men whip women without interference, remonstrance, or any expression
of indignation, must have a certain quality, which is an essential part of personal
honour with us, greatly blunted, if not entirely destroyed. The same quality
which we detest in the assassination of an enemy, is essentially constant in all
slavery. It is found in effecting one’s will with another, when he cannot, if he
would, defend himself. Accustomed to this in every hour of their lives.
Southerners do not feel magnanimity and the “fair-play” impulse to be a
necessary part of the quality of “spirit,” courage, and nobleness. By spirit they
apparently mean only passionate vindictiveness of character, and by gallantry
mere intrepidity.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_71" href="#FNanchor_71" class="label">[71]</a> The real object of the systematic mail robbery which is maintained throughout
the South, and of the censorship of the press which is otherwise attempted,
was once betrayed by a somewhat distinguished Southern editor, Duff Green, in
the <i>United States Telegraph</i>, in the following words:—</p>

<p>“The real danger of this [slave insurrection] is remote. We believe we have
most to fear from the organized action upon the consciences and fears of the slaveholders
themselves; from the insinuation of their dangerous heresies into our
schools, our pulpits, and our domestic circles. It is only by alarming the consciences
of the weak and feeble, and diffusing among our people a morbid sensibility
on the question of slavery, that the Abolitionists can accomplish their object.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_74" href="#FNanchor_74" class="label">[74]</a> From the <i>Columbia</i> (S. C.) <i>Times</i>, quoted without dissent in the conservative
South Carolina paper, the <i>Charleston Mercury</i>:—</p>

<p>“The loss that the South annually sustains by the running of slaves into
Canada, is of sufficient importance to justify her public men in insisting upon
some action of the Government of the United States in the premises. And we
confess our surprise that Southern statesmen have submitted with so much
patience to the annual robbery of thousands of dollars’ worth of property to which
she has as good a right as the land they cultivate. The time is propitious for the
acquisition of all disputed rights from European powers. They cannot afford
to break just now with the United States. Let our public men move in the
matter, and we question not but that the President and the American Minister at
St. James’s will give the movement a cordial support. Besides, this is a golden
moment which may never return. Before we get another sound man in the presidential
chair, peace may be made in Europe, and the European powers be less
inclined to look with favour upon the demands of America.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_75" href="#FNanchor_75" class="label">[75]</a> “While it is far more obvious that negroes should be slaves than whites, for
they are only fit to labour, not to direct; yet the principle of slavery is itself
right, and does not depend upon difference of complexion. Difference of race,
lineage, of language, of habits, and customs, all tend to render the institution more
natural and durable; and although slaves have been generally whites, still
the masters and slaves have generally been of different national descent. Moses
and Aristotle, the earliest historians, are both authorities in favour of this difference
of race, but not of colour.”—<i>Richmond Enquirer.</i></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_78" href="#FNanchor_78" class="label">[78]</a> The presence of these few planters, with their valuable human property,
makes the average nominal wealth of each white family, at first sight, appear
large. If, however, the slaves had been appraised at only $500 each, which
would be low, they would alone amount in value in some counties to the sum
assigned for the whole personal property of the citizens. This item is not, therefore,
trustworthy, but, in comparing the coast and second tier counties, it serves to
show the great difference in the average wealth of the citizens of each. A similar
division of personal estate, as officially returned for the city of New York, would
give $4,660 to each family.</p>
